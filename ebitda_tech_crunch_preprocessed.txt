Non-GAAP Financial Measures
This press release includes information relating to Adjusted EBITDA, which the Securities and Exchange Commission has defined as a «non-GAAP financial measure».
Adjusted EBITDA has been included in this press release because it is a key measure used by the company's management and board of directors to understand and evaluate core operating performance and trends, to prepare and approve its annual budget and to develop short- and long-term operational plans.
Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of Yelp's results as reported under GAAP.
Some of these limitations are:
Because of these limitations, you should consider Adjusted EBITDA alongside other financial performance measures, including various cash flow metrics, net income (loss) and Yelp's other GAAP results.
For a preliminary reconciliation of historical non-GAAP financial measures to the nearest comparable GAAP measures, see «Reconciliation of Net Loss to Adjusted EBITDA» included in this press release.
