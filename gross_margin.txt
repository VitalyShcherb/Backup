In news that should surprise no one by now — Apple once again had a stellar quarter and blew past Wall Street estimates for Q3 2010. Just as with Q1 and Q2 of this year, Apple has been doing so well thanks largely to the iPhone. But unlike those quarters, Apple now has an important new product adding money to their bottom line: the iPad (the iPad had been released just prior to the closing of Q2). And this quarter actually marked Apple’s best ever in terms both revenue and Mac shipments.
Apple posted a revenue of $15.7 billion for the quarter (again, a new record — beating even holiday quarters). And net quarterly profit was at $3.25 billion — $3.51 per diluted share. All of those easily beat both Apple’s own (always low) estimates, as well as Wall Street’s.
Apple sold 3.47 million Macs during Q3 — again, a new quarterly record. The company sold 8.4 million iPhones, which was down slightly from the 8.75 million they sold last quarter. But remember, that’s before the iPhone 4 (which went on sale just prior to the end of the quarter) and many customers likely held off on purchasing the iPhone 3GS to wait for the new iPhone. The company also sold 9.41 million iPods in Q3. This number continues to decline on a year-over-year basis as it’s being eaten by Apple’s other products, like the iPhone.
But the big number is the iPad sales. Apple moved 3.27 million units in Q3 2010, the first quarter they’ve reported sales. Yes, the iPad almost outsold the Mac — and that’s on record sales for the Mac.
All that being said, Apple’s gross margin did fall slight to 39.1 percent, versus 40.9 percent a year ago. Part of this is likely due to the iPad, which Apple is selling for relatively cheap (by its standards).
Of note, Apple CEO Steve Jobs chimed in with: “we have amazing new products still to come this year,” in the release. He also reiterated that the iPhone 4 was the most successful product launch in Apple’s history.
“Looking ahead to the fourth fiscal quarter of 2010, we expect revenue of about $18 billion and we expect diluted earnings per share of about $3.44,” Apple CFO Peter Oppenheimer noted in the release.

Below find live earnings call notes:
Peter Oppenheimer, Apple CFO
Q&A Time With CFO Peter Oppenheimer and COO Tim Cook
Q: What is corporate adoption for iPhone, iPad, Mac?
TC: 60% of Fortune 500 are deploying or piloting iPhone. Education doing great too. The Mac had the best quarter — a lot of it is education as well. In the first 90 days of the iPad we have 50% of the Fortune 100 deploying or testing the iPad — “it’s incredible.”
Q: Supply demand breakdown for the product categories?
TC: Mac and iPod had no significant supply/demand issues. iPad and iPhone are significantly different. The iPhone 4 significantly is backlogged. We’re still selling them as fast as we can make them. Same with the iPad. “It’s a good problem to have.” High demand is never a problem (laughs). We went into iPad thinking that 1 million a month would be a bold move, analysts thought that too. We blew through that. Increasing capacity as fast as we can.
Q: How are iPhone 4 margins? Why are those on the negative side for next quarter?
PO: We had some adjustments in our supply chain — that helped us last quarter. But next quarter, the iPhone 4 has higher cost structure. The magin there is attractive, but it’s higher than iPhone 3GS.
Q: What about the iPhone 3GS ramp down, how did that affect sales for the quarter?
TC: Lower sales after June 7 waiting for iPhone 4 launch. It definitely affected the quarter.
Q: Why problems with meeting demand for product launches?
TC: “We do not purposefully create a shortage for buzz. I’m not sure where that comes from.” “Demand for iPhone 4 is absolutely stunning.” I don’t know when we’ll be able to
Q: With the antenna – any changes in demand?
TC: “Let me be very clear on this: We are selling every unit we can make, currently.”
Q: So no slow down in order rates online (post antennagate)? Increase in returns?
TC: “My phone is ringing off the hook from people who want more supply.”
Q: Increase in returns?
TC: The returns we’ve seen on the iPhone is less than the iPhone 3GS, as Steve said on Friday. “For this specific issue, it’s extremely small”
Q: Talk more about iPad demand.
TC: It took 20+ months to sell the first million iPods. It’s one month for iPad. It’s not taking a typical early-adopter curve. Our guts tell us that this market is very big. And the iPad is defining the market.
Q: How’s the 3G iPad doing?
PO: We don’t disclose the split. But all of the models have been very popular.
Q: Updates on iAds?
PO: Yeah we just launched in the early part of July. We plan to learn a lot this calendar year and build a foundation for the future.
Q: How’s the NC datacenter coming?
PO: It’s on-schedule. We expect it completed by the end of the calendar year.
Q: What impact did iPad have on gross margins?
PO: Things were as we thought. We did a little bit better than we thought (in margin) thanks to more iPhone and accessory sales.
Q: Is there cannibalization of iPod by the iPad?
PO: Our iPod ASPs were down about $7 sequentially, but that’s mostly due to back-to-school promotions and a stronger U.S. dollar.
Q: Will iPad margins increase over time?
PO: We are purposefully agressive with the iPad (pricing) — this will continue.
Q: Impact of the bumpers?
PO: We will need to defer revenue for iPhone 4s we sell where we haven’t delivered the bumpers or haven’t heard from them. It should be about $175 million in the September quarter. We will expense the cost of the bumpers when we ship them to customers. We will take care of every customer.
Q: What about Android shipment increases?
TC: Haven’t seen the reports since June. But iPhone sales were up 61% in the quarter despite the iPhone 4 coming. We’re growing substantially faster than the market.
Q: iPad demand?
TC: Anecdotally, I think it’s beyond the early adopters already, as I’ve said. I don’t know what the competition will do. I know they’re working on things. Maybe people will subsidize them, but I’m not sure people really want another contract in their lives.
Q: App Store rules still arbitrary?
PO: I think that we are always looking to make our developers happy. We just crossed $1 billion in payments to developers. And now iAds are another revenue stream.
TC: The vast majority of apps are approved within 7 days of their submission. And most of the ones that don’t make it are because of bugs. But we want to make sure that pornography and graphic scenes don’t make it. I know that 100% don’t agree.
Q: Mac sales trending towards portables?
TC: When we announce new portables, you’ll see a movement there. That’s more of what we saw this time. But still, there’s an overall move toward mobility. Portables will continue to grow.
Q: Talk about FaceTime as an open standard. Any color there?
TC: I want to focus on financial questions today. So let’s save that one for another day.
Q: Why isn’t North America on the hot iPhone numbers list?
TC: I think that the market will increasingly become a smartphone market. Steve said that long ago — it’s becoming true. We have a lot of opportunity all around the world. But our growth as a company is happening faster internationally — that’s for all products. But it’s huge for the Americas too.
Q: What about broadening in China and India for the iPhone?
TC: I think both Mac, iPhone, and later iPad there is still extraordinary opportunity left. In Asia-Pacific the Mac grew 73% year over year. In China it’s over 100%.
Q: Might there be a reverse iPad halo effect?
TC: That’s a very good question. I think that’s what we focus on internally. The iPod created a Halo for the Mac. Could that happen with iPhone and iPad? We’ll see, I don’t want to predict it. But the Mac share is up 17 straight quarters. But it’s still low. There’s still room to grow. There’s a lot of PCs to cannibalize. It’s still a huge market.
Q: Domestically, do you need to expand your beyond one carrier?
TC: I will say that we’re very happy to be a partner with AT&T. They’ve been a first-class partner. They’ve pioneered things. That’s all I have to say about that.
That’s a wrap.

What makes Apple tick? How is it that it came back from the dead to surpass both Google and Microsoft in market cap?  French consulting firm faberNovel takes a stab at explaining Apple’s success and its strategy against its two main rivals in the SlideShare above.  (In the past, faberNovel has created similar slideshows about Google).
The 48-slide presentation, titles “Apple: 8 Easy Steps To Beat Microsoft (And Google),”  boils Apple’s strategy down to eight steps including “the arrogance of simplicity” (Step 1) to customer lock-in (Step 3), selling at a premium (Step 4), cross-selling products (Step 5), and, of course, think different (Step 7).  Much of this is not new information, but seeing it all in a detailed slide presentation helps put Apple’s various moves in context.
Apple starts by stripping away complexity from computing products, paring down features in favor of making their products more effortless to master.  Apple locks in customers by controlling every aspect of a product through vertical integration.  For instance, it doesn’t make much money from iTunes, but that is how it keeps customers coming back.  It makes its money from hardware, which it sells at a premium.  It has been able to increase its gross margins from 23 percent in 2001 to 40 percent last year.
Over that time period, it went from a niche, high-end computer maker to a consumer electronics company.  But its iPods, iPhones, and iPads bring new consumers into the Mac fold and drive sales of Mac computers, which of course work better with all of its other devices.  The iPod, iPhone, and now the iPad are what drive mainstream adoption for Apple and have propelled it to become the powerhouse it is today.

The part of the presentation which is the most insightful is when it illustrates the thinking behind Apple’s emerging cloud strategy.  While iTunes in the cloud is a foregone conclusion, that might just be the first wisp of an entirely new product strategy.
When Apple started to make other devices such as the iPod, iPhone, and Apple TV, they were designed to connect to the Mac as the digital hub syncing and managing all of these devices and others like digital cameras.  These began as media creation and consumption devices, but then evolved into communications devices in their own right. Applications were the glue that connected these devices to the computer hub.

But now we are entering the post-PC era with the iPhone and the iPad, depending on the Mac as a central, orchestrating digital hub no longer makes any sense.  iPhones and iPads are powerful computers in their own right. The new hub is the cloud, which can manage many more devices and offer much more powerful computing experiences (“speech recognition, unlimited storage”) than any personal computer.
Google is already all about the cloud. Microsoft is moving in that direction, and so will Apple.  The new glue tying its devices to the cloud will be iTunes and MobileMe, which faberNovel predicts Apple will make free because of its strategic potential to lock customers into the Apple universe.  Instead of syncing your devices to your computer, MobileMe syncs them to the cloud. And why store all of your songs and movies on your computer, when you can stream them from iTunes in the cloud?  (That is why Apple bought Lala).  There is unlimited storage, it is all in one place accessible from any device, and Apple can start charging subscription fees for streaming music and movies.  Throw your photos up there too as an extra backup while you are at it.

Music blog Musically has jumped on the new accounts of Spotifyâs UK Limited company to reveal some interesting figures, to say the least. The accounts also reveal that at the end of 2009, Spotifyâs parent company Spotify Technology SA was negotiating further funding.
The most interesting stat, to me at least is that Spotify started 2009 with around one million users and ended  with seven million users across Europe, of whom over 250,000 were paid-up subscribers. That is a sevenfold increase.
The latest official Spotify numbers , says the company, is that they had over 10 million registered users (in October this year) and over 500,000 subscribers across Europe (a figure revealed in June).
But assuming the growth rate in the second year was slower, letâs call it a two to threefold increase, then Spotify could well be heading toward 15 million users by the end of the year, and 750,000 to 1 million paying subscribers. Letâs hope for their sake they are.
A company spokes person commented on the 2009 figures: â2009 saw us focus on establishing a new and innovative music service and bringing it to millions of people across Europe. The groundwork laid in our launch year has been crucial to the significant achievements made in 2010. Further strengthening and expansion of the service remains our top priority.â
Since October 2008, it has paid more than â¬40 million to rightsholders, with â¬30 million of those payments coming in the first eight months of 2010.
In other words, although Spotifyâs startup costs have been hefty, itâs user-base is giving it traction. The jury is out the door on how it can maintain that, but as investor Sean Parker says, once users have built playlists, collected albums and used the mobile app âweâve got you by the balls.â So itâs just waiting for that grip to tighten, as it were.
Lastly, we hear from reliable sources that Spotify is prepping a launch in the U.S. soon, despite a yearâs delay. This could either happen in late December or early in the New Year. Watch this space, I guess.
Here are highlights of the 2009 financial accounts for Spotify Limited, its UK-headquartered arm that is really the guts of the operations:
â¢ The operating loss was Â£16.4 million for 2009 as a whole
â¢ Net loss after taxation was Â£16.66 million
â¢ Revenues for 2009 were Â£11.32 million
â¢ Cost of sales was Â£18.82 million
â¢ Distribution was Â£608,711
â¢ Administrative expenses were Â£8.29 million
Spotifyâs revenue by category was:
â¢ Â£4.51 million from sales of advertisements in 2009, just under 40% of revenue
â¢ Â£6.81 million from subscriptions, just over 60% of revenue
â¢ At the end of 2009 it had 23 employees
â¢ Staff costs were Â£1.17 million
It ended 2009 with:
â¢ Just over Â£2 million in cash plus Â£12.1 million of assets in trade and other receivables
â¢ Â£21.47 million of liabilities in the form of trade and other payables.
I love Spotify. Since paying for it I have stopped using iTunes for music. iTunes is only used to back up my iPhone and download podcasts.
[…] Read the rest of this entry » […]
i use grooveshark since they started and even on my iphone. if you jailbreak your iphone you can install their application and it works like a charm. besides other nice features like more tabs in safari and quick reply text messages etc.
Most of the music played on Grooveshark makes no money for rights holders cos they are Not Licensed!  It is really hard for legal services to make money – thats why they need your support.
Are you familiar with the concept that growing into a new territory increases rather than decreases cash needs?  Customer acquisition, local infrastructure, etc., etc.  If you want to stop losing money, you concentrate on getting cash flow out of your existing business.  This headline is asinine.
Not to say that Spotify won’t expand, but please actually put some thought into the article.
IMHO, there is no way to make profits for Spotify if
– 1 over 20 users pays for the service
– 100% of the music heard by 100% of the users has to be paid to the rightholders with actual fees.
The size of the market does not change anything if the 5% freemium rate does not rapidly become at least 30%, or if the fees paid to the rightholders are not decreasing dramatically.
The business model problem is likely amplified because the early adopters are the most likely to convert to paying accounts.  As user base grows, the freemium-to-paid conversion rate is likely to decrease.
That said, I really hope VCs pump tons of money into this company so I can get free music while the party lasts.
win! :)
Also, a lot of the subscriptions come from deals (Eg. getting a new mobile subscription) which means that they might not get renewed after that 1 year.
I have used this argument several times. The independent Norwegian artist Ugress is already making more profit on Spotify than iTunes. This even though about 20% of his market is in the US, where Spotify isn’t available. In my opinion it is ignorant to state that there isn’t money to be made on streaming. In the end, artists weren’t left off with all that much revenue from CD sales neither. And comparing with radio the revenue is already at least an order of magnitude higher.
Link: http://www.ugress.com/post.asp?id=1452
Both Greg and Pierre above here are spot on. There’s no point in increasing the user base if you’re earnings per users are too low.
And that is why there haven’t been an US launch.
What sources have you used for evaluating their finances? And also could you detail why you believe the UK financial record represents the status for their business as a whole?
I can’t help but feel you’re speculating around their UK Ltd companies house figures. I think it’s fair to say that given UK corporation tax rates and Spotify’s presence in other countries you would be unlikely to find much profit there.
Sorry missed the link at the top!
2009 was first real year of international operation. If you think they should be clearing profit within year one you need to go back to business school.
I suspect they are going to clear a nice  profit in 2010 which is almost unheard of in start-ups like this (esp media).
The big unknown is what iTunes and Google are going to do about it but Spotify is still a major contender whatever they do.
Spotify will only be allowed to stay on the scene by the record labels if garners a big enough audience before they renegotiate the royalties an in a state where it would be fools hardy for the record companies to shut them down, that why a North American launch is nessecity for Spotify survival in the long term.
Spotify is also the only service proven to beat piracy. An Apple is so scared of the service that they have lobbying to try an block the service from entering the US markets, if the 15 million users hold true, in less than 2 years you can see why Apple is running scared.
The service also make Apple looks obsolete.
Revenues for 2009 were Â£11.32 million
Cost of sales was Â£18.82 million
That’s the interesting part. I understand that Spotify’s business philosophy is that you get them hooked by the free part, and eventually they’ll pay for it. But still. If your Gross Margin is already 7 million in the hole before any other expenses, that’s a real bad sign.
Of course what exactly are their CoS. If its just royalties then the problem is even bigger.
I don’t see Spotify in the game within 3 years.
Their proposition is not compelling enough. Ad free music is great, unless you have to pay for it. Grooveshark already does it for free – plus no need to download client software. Furthermore, when iTunes starts to offer a streaming, there won’t be room for many other players.
Artists are poorly compensated by Spotify. But I guess that’s the case for all streaming music providers. Ultimately the music industry cannot continue to sanction an “all you can eat” model since total revenues will decline further.
Music just doesn’t pay any more. There needs to be an industry wide effort to re-engineer revenue, distribution and compensation models.
– how has there not been an album selling more than 20m copies worldwide since 2004?
Don’t tell me it’s piracy! It’s industry complacency, ignorance and arrogance.
– how does a computer game (black ops) make $650m in 5 days?
Platform and game developers got their act together – that’s how! Labels, distributors and artists need to do the same.
The industry is allowing itself to be sliced, diced, given away for free (NOKIA express music anyone?), established artists screwed, new talent ignored. There will not be an industry in 10 years unless they get off their lazy fat asses and change.
Who cares about Spotify? All they are doing is raping a dead carcass…
Don’t insult Spotify by comparing it to Grooveshark.
I’m not a big fan of Spotify, but MAN! that was harsh.
I believe the fact of the matter is, music no longer means much to people anymore — It’s just a past time activity; AND fans are bored with the same old artists, and musicians that sing and produce the same old songs.
Spotify hasn’t really been able to convince the general public on how they’re any different from rdio, rhapsody, GrooveShark etc. For example, If Spotify differentiated itself from, let’s say grooveshark, by offering music from independent or not so popular artists, they could reduce their licensing costs, and perhaps make a lasting impression.
Overall, I just think there is too much competition in this space, and almost all of them are proposing/selling the same music that users can obtain anywhere…FOR FREE.
Grooveshark is not a fully licensed service. It amazes me that so many people dont know this.
Only EMI and Merlin have licensed them, both in return for stopping legal action. So most music played on Grooveshark pays NOTHING to rights holders. And they still sell advertising…and subscriptions to consumers.
Say it loud please…..Grooveshark is predominantly a pirate.
Spotify has stopped me, and almost all other Swedish university students, from pirating music, so that gotta account for something.
The continuation of the service really depends on if they can get enough users to pay for premium (I do as I cannot stand ads) or get enough advertisers.
The Spotifty app is also a godsend. I can sync music over wifi, not having to bother manually transfering the songs I want to my phone.
Spotify stopped me from pirating music too.
What would you do, if you ware a label ?
You allow user X that’s not paying for music to listen for free and bomb him with ads to make some money OR you spend hundreds of thousands on lawyers to shut down sites, and anyways, in the end X will download his music from a site you still didn’t manage to close, that’s running ads(but not yours).
Same here; Spotify is the first service that is more convenient than pirating (I pay for the service, despite being a poor student).
Same here, I haven’t downloaded any music in months now that spotify is here.
The experience is just truly amazing, it’s fast, interface is perfect. It just misses a bit of local content (ie french for me)
@JC
A small comment re album sales.
Online and mobile purchasing of music has meant its now much easier to purchase singles. Many more customers now browse and buy the tracks they want, rather than albums. This could account for no album sales >20m since 2004.
If you look at singles figures, there’s plenty of evidence to suggest that consumption is still high.
I gotta feeling… Don’t matter….Hips don’t lie. ;)
Spotifyh has changed my musical life. It’s simply e smartest app that’s come out in the last ten years. It makes iTunes prehistoric and clumsy and expensive. The best thing about spottily is the way you can share you playlists with friends via Facebook connect. This simple feature makes discovering new music insanely easy and personal at the same time. Also the drag and drop feature means you can drop a track you like to friends (with a little note) in a second. How simple and effortless is that? If I want to play my music at a mates house, I just log into my account. It’s just hands down the best thing out there. I heart Spotify.
AGREED: Spotify has changed my musical life. Itâs simply the best app thatâs come out since Google launched. It makes iTunes prehistoric, clumsy, and expensive.
Youtube is still the easiest place to get pirate music… or is it legal ? I can’t remember… but that’s youtubes problem.
I would say that depends on your jurisdiction. In the Netherlands, where I currently live, you have a right for a private copy. In Germany you could get busted – but you can’t listen to most music on youtube there anyways, because our RIAA-equivalent GEMA has intervened to do that…
I love Spotify, and I agree 110% from one of the above commenters who said its stopped him from pirating music!
I can’t believe all the Americans are trashing Spotify, is it because it wasn;t made across the pond?
Use it before you comment on it!
@Paul Cockerton – yes I agree, single sales are high in relation to album sales due to listening habits. However “hips don’t lie” is the only single in the 2000’s to sell more than >10m. The other singles to have sold ~10m were from 1942, 1967, 1966 & 1971! You have to go back to 1997 to find a single that sold more than “hips don’t lie”.
Overall consumption is way down. Last year it was 7% down on the previous. Look here for the last 10 years sales figures:
http://bit.ly/bYXUAW
And to everyone who likes Spotify, I have to agree it’s a great technology. But then so is bittorrent. Both are killing the music industry and will eventually preside over a very large, but static catalog of artists who used to earn their living in the music industry.
@JC So you are saying that Spotify, whom does pay an not insignificant amount of money to rightholders is killing the music industry? Compared to Bittorrent there are 40 milion reasons why Spotifty is preferable.
40% of Spotifty’s revenue does come from the ads in the free version. I can imagine this will increase as the number of users and knowledge about the platform grows.
One must also remember that you can actually buy Mp3s inside Spotify. I don’t know how many that actually uses this feature but it is there.
Spotify is currently one of the biggest income sources for artists in Sweden (http://di.se/Artiklar/2010/10/26/218516/Spotify-pa-vag-forbi-skivhandeln/ Swedish article). Spotify killing the industry? Not really.
I highly doubt they’re earning much from the freemium model, simply because it can be avoided (simply close the Spotify app when an ad comes on, and load up spotify again.. takes 2 secs) so because of this ineffective technique, they’ve killed off their concept.
They put too many ads, which mean I would rather download and keep them forever. It’s not that isn’t affordable, it’s that we are so use to downloading music for free.
I say, unfortunately, Spotify could be hitting the deadpool soon.

This is a guest post by Tim O’Shea (Twitter: @timothyoshea), founder of Blurtit, co-founder of Qhub and most recently co-founder of the short lived UK group buying website Snippa.  He addresses challenges facing the group buying site market in the UK following the explosion of Groupon clone style startups through his own experience with Snippa.
On a trip to New York in November 2009 I stumbled across Groupon for the first time. The deal displayed for New York seemed too good to be true and despite the obvious active community I quickly closed the page.
However, within a few weeks of my return I revisited Groupon again after reading the first Groupon TechCrunch post and decided that the UK needed this service badly. It appears I wasn’t the only one thinking the same thing! I put together a team with my co-founder David Hobart at the end of 2009 and set about building a business focused initially on London. By March 2010 it was clear that we weren’t going to be able to do what we set out to do in the short term (offer exceptional deals to our customers) and that some of the competition were clearly out gunning us. So Snippa was closed down a few weeks after its launch. In this post I’m going to share what I learnt about the group buying market in the UK at a time when a large number of similar startups are chasing the same goal.
Challenges Facing The UK Group Buying Market 
The number of players
Due to the number of players, commission levels are being eroded far from the 40-50% that Groupon achieves down to 0% just to get the deal (at Snippa our deals averaged around 10-20%). Merchants are getting numerous phone calls from prospective group buying companies and the conversation with many is more about the commission level charged rather than how they could offer a great discount for a group of new customers. This will continue until a clear leader emerges that can demonstrate a large customer base allowing them to negotiate better deals and commission levels. Many companies chasing the same deal is counter productive for the end customer.
Market size
The UK does not have the volume of high population cities (compared to the US) so the competition is even more focused on London as the top prize. Throughout Europe there is more scope, but launching in every country with its individual particularities will take a pan-European focused and well funded company.
Starting with no marketing list
There is a good reason Groupon makes you enter your email address before viewing the deals, the size and effectiveness of the email list is key. Any startup addressing their list en mass before putting deals live will stand a far higher chance of success and good funding helps solve this. It is worth remembering that Groupon started as The Point, a platform for collective action, and that members started using the site to organise group purchases.
How To Win The War 
Product and distribution. Great product has shown it will spread (see the MyCityDeal film offer below). We at Snippa had hoped to be able to compete with heavily funded competitors by focusing on great product to build distribution with limited expense (in a similar way that Zappo focus budget on customer service rather than marketing). Whilst we managed to get good deals, the killer deal was out of our reach due to the amount of competition, meaning our product distribution strategy was questionable. Moving forward this may change as the number of competitors merge and dwindle. On reflection we should have built the distribution list first.
Distribution is currently being built via email sign up by the following methods: Refer a friend, Twitter, Adwords PPC, PR, affiliate schemes, Facebook fan pages (built by Facebook PPC) and loss leader deals. A large customer acquisition budget is needed ongoing to secure market share.
Leading the Pack 
MyCityDeal are clear leaders in terms of current customer base and funding in the UK. Deals such as the £1 film voucher, selling (they claim) in excess of 27,000, has allowed them to buy a large customer base. This deal looks to have been subsidized (at an estimated cost of £125k+) but has been really effective in launching them in the UK. Well funded with an experienced team, MyCityDeal look likely to succeed.
Groupon are yet to launch in London but are amassing email addresses and deals. When they launch, expect their offering to be very strong. No UK startup has been able to build the exceptional branding and community and feel Groupon has achieved. Additionally the lessons they have learnt operating in the USA will give them a clear advantage.
Wahanda seem to have traction in terms of Heath/Spa/Beauty but due to the niche can not go for the bigger cross product offering Groupon and MyCityDeal are after.
Recently launched Keynoir (following a merger with DealBunch) have an experienced team, well known backers and £1.3m funding from Index Ventures and PROfounders Capital. Although it is too early to see if they will gain traction, they certainly have the credentials to do so.
Huge funding or an existing customer base look to be the the features of a successful group buying startup.
And Bringing Up The Rear 
Surprisingly, Groupola don’t appear to be selling large quantities despite a massive email list from MyVoucherCodes.co.uk and a strong company behind them. Others such as Dealmob, Wowcher, Vivavoucher, Mypiggyback are all selling but in small quantities. LikeBees and KGB deals (part of the 118 118 group) are worth watching. To stand a chance of being a market leader, these players need to raise significant funding or need to find a creative way of building a list, such as partnering with someone that already has one.
Predictions For The Future 
The UK will have two dominant players, each achieving a smaller market share than the if there was one, thus not achieving the traction Groupon has achieved in the US. MyCityDeal I believe is on target to be the strongest throughout Europe. Any new players coming into the market will need to either have large current distribution or high levels of funding to compete at the top level. There will be space for a number of smaller players if they are able slowly build customers over the next two to three years. A number of niche players (such as Wahanda) will achieve traction, but not at the Groupon deal volumes.

Other Group Buying Opportunities 
Group buying in the daily deal format has been proven as a scalable business, as such expect iterations be applied in different formats:
Local businesses with low buy ins: Opening the group buy to a local businesses platform for smaller deal volumes in a self service format. For example, a small local hairdresser wants to fill 5 chairs of unsold inventory on a quiet Thursday afternoon.
Group buying for business services: Many business services have large gross margins allowing for great discounts, thus taking the risk out of working with a new supplier.
Existing communities: Websites (Facebook Pages, Forums, Blogs etc) with an existing community are in a great position to add a group buying feature for their members (imagine if TechCrunch did a group buy on cloud servers!).
What I Would Do Differently 
In the rush to launch Snippa we forgot to innovate and iterate significantly, we would have been better off evaluating the competition more throughly and taking action before launching. Ways to compete could have been taking the model to a niche (rather than go head to head against the mass of competition) or alternatively putting resources into finding a novel way to build a customer list.
Great article. Just a few mistakes.
1) The number of sold vouchers that MyCityDeal shows are absolutely fake. MCD does not pay merchants upfront but only after the redemption of the voucher. Using this strategy they can say that several vouchers have been sold (anyway they do not have to pay the merchants for the fake ones) even if the real number is much lower. Then they go to the next merchant to secure another deal using the successful fake numbers of previous merchants. It is also a good strategy to tell the customers that a lot of people already bought so it must be good. For instance they did not sell 27000 for the cinema. They put that number there so people like you believe it and write an article about it.
2) Vivavoucher is out of the market. They had the same deal for a month now. Mypiggyback is not a serious player. And Wahanda is not exactly a competitor; it is more the yellow pages for Beauty.
3) Merchants are getting pissed off with MyCityDeal. I have spoken to many and they all say that only a tiny percentage of people who apparently bought the offer are showing up. In addition MCD has a very poor customer service and aggressive merchant relationship. Also the contract that they show to merchants is illegal.
4) If Groupon comes (and when…) it will be good for small players. It will increase awareness of the industry. It will be easier to get merchants that do not want to wait long to be featured on Groupon.
Great article.
James, thanks for you comments, you’re more up to date than me!
>27000 for the cinema. They put that number there so people like you believe it and write an article about it.
I know MCD used to have deals in cities that clearly didn’t exist but I thought the film deal was true. Do have proof that this is not true? Clearly not being transparent will not help them.
I believe Wahanda is worth watching though they have taken the model to a community and that is very interesting.
Hi Tim,
I know this because I have spoken to several merchants that featured a deal with MyCityDeal. Most told me that until then just a very little percentage of the vouchers sold had been redeemed. I have also spoken to former sales people of MyCityDeal and they confirmed that. Also have a look at how their sold number increases during the day. It is usually steady for a while then goes up in a second by a lot of people and that pattern continues. Also as soon as the deal is live at midnight they have already a few people that bought (their deal is always on, no tipping point). And then again it does not move for a while. Check also their Facebook fan page. Users do not comment much. Definitely too little compared to the number they sold.
If you better analyze their facebook fan page you also see that they have many fake fans. There are companies that you can pay and give you fans (fake profiles).
I was watching the cinema deal with my eyes. I went to the toilet and when I came back there were 3000 more sold. And then did not move for a while.
Additionally if you read their standard contract for merchants you will laugh. 1 page. Many clauses are illegal and the exclusivity states that for 2 years the merchants cannot use any other advertisement channels.
Anyway being funded is the key. There are better start-ups out there but they are not funded. VCs should get smarter and put some money in the small companies. Considering all the money MCD has, they have not done that much. And they are burning a lot of it.
Best
Great post indeed Tim.
Seems like James is in the sector as well :) I confirm what he is saying about MCD, they only pay for redeemed vouchers, which allows them to make numbers up on their website. Several merchants I’ve spoken to are *NOT* happy about it…
Great article – it’s a big battle now that should play itself out in the next 3 months.   My money is on Keynoir, Wahanda, or Likebees.
Fantastic article. Really interesting points from Tim – how are MyCityDeal getting away with making up figures? Surely the merchants they work with would question why they’ve only had 10 customers if they sold over 300 on the site???
Agree with Jason – I think Wahanda have got it right by concentrating on one niche area – spa and beauty. Merchants get more than just a one off offer plus they have the community and reviews. Other one to watch is Keynoir, which still needs to prove itself but have the expertise to do it well !!
I think that the winner will be the one that will have best deals and which will manage to attract reasonable communities from smaller cities to expand their operations. It is not easy to create a group buying community in let’s say Brighton, keeping this community engaged will be matter of really great deals.
James,
I do not see the point of your tenacity against MyCityDeal… are you a competitor of them?
I had actually no idea about how they pay merchant and thanks for pointing it out, I see that paying merchants in this way is very profitable for them (they get 100% of the money and pay only a part of it!), however you have also to consider that voucher usually expire in 6 months or so and merchants should make their balance at the end of the period, not a few days or weeks after.
Regarding your comment about the fake numbers on the website, I used to work in IT and this could simply be the result of how they have implemented the update function of the results.
Bye,
G.
Hi,
I have very simple question – how does the merchant validate a voucher? If I print it put twice will I get discount two times?
Thanks for the answer!
The merchant gets a list of all the vouchers and ticks them off as they are used.
So in fact it’s problematic, especially when u sell 1000 vouchers and poor guy has list consisting of 20 pages :)
Good article, I look forward to seeing how this all plays out over the next few months.
Hey guys,
I think mycitydeal is the leader in this race. I regard the other comments as pure envy of bad loosers. I think myself having bought a cinema voucher and several other deals I have nothing but respect for those guys. I wish them all the best,
C
Tim
I see Wowcher is featured all over Kelkoo. They must be doing something with them. If they are it will make them a very big player in this space
What’s realy funny is that since this article has been launched groupola has exploding numbers. Suddenly a boring Yoga Deal in Liverpool has 258 buyers. They must be really desperate if they listen to the hear say in here and fake their numbers. I heard quite some stories from people in their salesforce who do not get paid their comission as literally none of their deal have tipped so far. Quite some of their business partners seem to be pissed off as well as they do not deliver the volumes they display on their website. Wonder for how long they can do this…
[…] from the 6 group-buy sites, whilst in the UK DealRomeo is offering deal feeds, aggregating the burgeoning number of new British Group-Buy […]
I notice from my research Groupola are faking their numbers just to push the fact they are the largest growing UK group buying site – which isn’t true.
Very interesting article. In Rainmaking we have played around with the group buying concept for 1½ years. First starting in Denmark with group buying of branded physical products. It was a pretty good success until the mother companies of the brands stopped the local dealers to offer heavy discounts. Not legal – but a difficult fight to take …
We are still testing different group buying formats – including services like fitness memberships. See http://www.gymgroupie.co.uk (will soon relaunch with adapted concept).
In my opinion there will emerge a lot of different group buying concepts in the future. The market will be segmented and cluster around special niches.
Currently, too many only focus on discounts and getting volume through heavily funded marketing activities. I think many sites would benefit from looking at how they can create real value for their suppliers/partners. This will be a significant key to long term success.

I am currently in Vilnius attending a 54 hour startupweekend with 150+ entrepreneurs. More than 30 people made pitches tonight and as usual there were a couple of Groupon clones and look alike – unfortunately not yet with any significant new business model.
However, there were some other good teams and I hope to come back with some potential candidates for our accelerator program – startupbootcamp.dk.
/Carsten
Has anyone else noticed that Groupola has added 100+ sales to all there deals since this article has been added.
(Sorry I missed all the comments before me about Groupola faking there sales)
I was going to go in to this space my self but it seems that MyCityDeal are the only people selling a good amount and I know Groupon are planning of launching in the next 4 weeks so I think I will miss this one out.
Peter
It’s funny how a few months ago TC wrote an article about how well ‘Groupon’ were doing and suddenly we have x100 clones. This reminds me of the million dollar homepage days!
Anyway, off to build my Groupon clone…script anyone?
Why does everyone assume the UK will follow the US model, with one or two players becoming the “Groupons of Europe”?  Isn’t group buying just a product feature, that any community site might implement, esp. where the community is based around a specific geography?  (E.g. the Evening Standard might use this in London.)  A tech startup in the US was the right company to innovate this new business model, but that doesn’t mean a tech startup is the right company to emulate it here.
@Yali: In Germany there already is westdeal.de by the WAZ publishing house, which is essentially an extension for their newspaper WAZ and the portal derwesten.de .
Well in my opinion mycitydeal is just faking the numbers and their deals are not genuine, i read many forums and found so many complaints about them.
to be honest i am not in the favour of any group buying website but i would say that i do like Groupola.Com. i bought many deals from them and all of them were genuinue.
Also groupola.com is launched by myvouchercodes which gives me more reliability.
Obvisouly Choice is yours!!
@Jim
I’m sorry Jim but you obviously work for Groupola or MyVoucherCodes as I have heard nothing but bad things about Groupola.
I even saw a tweet from a top Sky executive saying there customer service is appalling after using them him self and after reading this article I have sat and watched them fake ALL there sales by even adding 300 extra sales to one deal!? come on that is just crazy…
I’m not saying that you can or can’t trust any of these sites as most of them look legit to me but I know for a FACT that Groupola are faking sales and are just giving start ups in the UK a bad name.
Johnny
are there any clones of this in Asia already?

eBay squeezed past the Street’s expectations, reporting first quarter profits of 42 cents a share (or $554.2 million) on revenues of $2.2 billion, analysts were looking for profits of 41 cents a share. Revenues gained 9% from the year ago, thanks to a jump in sales in the Payments and the Marketplace businesses. Gross margins dropped slightly to 30.6% in the period, down from 30.7%, driven by growth in PayPal (a relatively lower-margin business). “We are improving the fundamentals of our business, strengthening eBay Marketplaces and aggressively growing PayPal to become the leader in global online payments,” CEO John Donahoe said in the press release.
For the second quarter, eBay is looking for revenues of $2.15 to $2.20 billion and non-GAAP earnings of $0.37 to $0.39 a share.
The company’s Payments division continues to be eBay’s growth driver, achieving a record first quarter as PayPal gained increased traction on eBay. Some key numbers: overall payment volume rose 35% to $21.3 billion, sales advanced 26% to $809.3 million. In the release, eBay said it remains “focused on consumer and merchant adoption on and off eBay, expansion of PayPal’s open platform initiative and the ongoing integration of Bill Me Later.” On the Payments end, there were several news events during the quarter (including a major deal with China UnionPay), especially its progress on the mobile front. The company’s Send Money app was downloaded more than a million times in its first three weeks and PayPal X (a platform developers can use to process mobile transactions with PayPal) has already recorded $30 million in payment volume.
Its marketplaces segment, led by eBay, showed decent growth in the quarter, helped by currency fluctuations and overall revenue growth (sales added 13% to $1.4 billion).
Highlights From The Conference Call:
– Mobile is driving significant e-commerce and payments volume.
– Approximately 8 million merchants accept PayPay, 84 million active or registered accounts
– Nearly 60% of PayPal’s TPV comes from merchant services
– eBay’s Sold items in US, UK accelerated for the fourth consecutive quarter
– Still trying to position eBay as a fashion destination
– eBay’s mobile app has been downloaded 8.5 million times
– Marketplace turnaround is “on track”
– Maintaining full-year guidance
– 40% of PayPal’s TPV (total payments volume) was generated outside the US, versus 35% for the year ago period
– 60% of Marketplaces’ revenues were generated outside of the US, versus 54% for the year ago period.
– Expects PayPal’s global take rate to come down more during the course of the year.
– Ongoing weakness in Western Europe.
– On Asia, visiting China: “Man, there’s just really, really impressive growth.”
– In addition to the China UnionPay deal, eBay has signed deals w. Singapore, South Africa, and Japanese payment gateways.
– PayPal will grow faster than expected and margins will be higher this year, increasingly confidence in marketplace changes. That will be somewhat offset by currency and tax rate issues.
-Still expects margins in marketplace business to be 42% for the rest of the year.

Apple enjoyed strength across the board in the second quarter of 2010, with overall gross margins rising to 41.7% in the quarter, that’s an increase from 39.9% for Q2 2009 (and 40.9% for the prior quarter.) iPhone global sales surged, with astounding growth in Asia, while  Mac sales remained robust in the second quarter. The company is still rapidly adding Mac converts— about  half of the Macs sold in the quarter from Apple stores were to people who had never owned a Mac, according to the conference call.
Abroad, it was all about the iPhone: 474% increase in Asia Pacific, 183% gain in Japan and 133% gain in Europe. Speaking of Asia, overall sales in greater China were impressive, with revenues for the first half of 2010 up 200%— that’s the first time Apple has released that break down. In regards to retail stores, the company is opening 2 stores in Shanghai later this year, and has plans to open 25 stores in China by the end of 2011.
The company’s second quarter report (its best non-holiday quarter ever) easily smashed Wall Street’s expectations with revenues of $13.5 billion and profits of $3.33 a share or $3.07 billion, far beyond expectations for $2.45 a share.
Here’s a quick breakdown of the products:

The number of desktops sold rose 40% year over year, while portable sales advanced 28% (but revenues were up only 17%, due to lower prices). The number of iPods sold actually dropped 1%, but revenues jumped 12% (probably on lower NAND flash pricing). The iPhone of course saw the biggest year over year gain, enjoying a 131% jump. Those numbers are roughly on par with NPD’s latest estimates (predicted sales: 10 million iPods, up to 2.9 million Macs), although its call on the  iPhone was too low.

Apple has just announced its earnings for Q2 2010 — as we’ve come to expect from the company, it’s been another amazing quarter. Revenues were $13.5 billion destroying both their own and the Street’s estimates. Net quarterly profit came in at $3.07 billion — $3.33-a-share. The key blurb from CEO Steve Jobs in the release:
“We’re thrilled to report our best non-holiday quarter ever, with revenues up 49 percent and profits up 90 percent,” said Steve Jobs, Apple’s CEO. “We’ve launched our revolutionary new iPad and users are loving it, and we have several more extraordinary products in the pipeline for this year.”
The Street estimates had been earnings of $2.45-a-share on revenues of $12.04 billion. Apple’s own guidance (which is always low) had been between $2.06 to $2.18-a-share on revenues of $11 to $11.4 billion. So yeah, Apple killed it.
Other key numbers include that the company sold 2.94 million Macs (up 33% over last year), 8.75 million iPhones (up 131% over last year), and 10.89 million iPods (down 1% over last year) during the quarter. No direct iPad figures were given.
Last quarter, the holiday quarter, Apple solid 8.7 million iPhones, so the fact that they eclipsed that (and were up 131% versus a year ago) is very, very impressive. Of course, now that we all know the iPhone HD (or whatever you choose to call it) is coming, sale the next quarter might dip a bit (of course, everyone should have known new hardware was coming anyway, just as it does every Summer).
Apple also shifted guidance for next quarter upward considerably. CFO Peter Oppenheimer noted that revenue should be in the $13 billion to $13.4 billion range. Again, Apple always gives low numbers, so you can probably expect the actual numbers, when reported, to be much higher.
Below find notes from the earnings call:
On the call are CFO Peter Oppenheimer, COO Tim Cook, and Apple’s Treasurer.
Oppenheimer: Outstanding March quarter results exceeding our expectations. Best non-holiday quarter ever. Highest quarterly iPhone sales ever. Best Mac sales in a March quarter. Revenue up 49% over prior March quarter. iPhone sales more than doubled (over last year). Net income was up 91% over the year-ago quarter.
We just updated the MacBook Pro line. 3 and 4 weeks of Mac channel inventory. iPod sales were about equal (down 1%) — sales of iPod touch were up 61% year over year though. iPod revenue growth (12%) was the strongest growth in 2 years. Share is still over 70%.
3,500 new apps for the iPad so far. 185,000 apps overall.
All-time high for iPhone sales, beating our previous record last quarter. We have iPhone on 151 carriers in 88 countries. In Asia, Australia, Japan, and Europe, sales were strong.
Extremely pleased with iPad sales over the past few weeks. iPad with 3G will ship April 30 in the U.S.
$1.68 billion revenue from Apple Stores — way up from last year. 47 million visitors during the quarter – and increase of 20% over last year’s quarter. 40 to 50 new stores in 2010.
Gross margin was 41.7%.
Cash is $41.7 billion, up $1.9 billion from last quarter. The priority is preservation of capital.
Looking forward, iPad sales should be strong — and a new product transition should help sales (maybe the new iPhone?).
—————- Q&A Time ———————
Q: iPad is off to a fast start — any insights?
Cook: We don’t have enough experience to judge things yet. We’ll see how it goes. We’re thrilled with the sales so far.
Q: Were Mac sales slower in March due to the iPad?
Cook: If you look at the previous March we announced a new iMac and new Mac mini, this year we didn’t have that, so you can’t judge it on that, really.
Q: What about WiFi vs. 3G iPad?
Cook: Too early to tell what the mix will be.
Q: Why not put guidance higher for next quarter?
Oppenheimer: Some of it is lower iTunes sales (people use gift cards after the holidays). Mac sales should be up. iPod should decline year over year, as it has been doing. iPhone, we’re not sure. iPad is also a wait-and-see with the 3G version coming and it coming to other countries in May.
Q: Why was iPhone so good? It was staggering.
Cook: We had some staggering growth rates. 474% in Asia Pacific region. 183% growth in Japan. 133% growth in Europe. A lot of this was adding new carrier partners.
Q: What about China?
Cook: China has been interesting. Up 9 times year over year. Through the first half of this fiscal year, our revenue from China is almost $1.3 billion — that’s up over 200% year over year. (That includes Hong Kong.)
Q: How quickly can you ramp up iPad production?
Cook: We’ve done well versus our planned capacity. There isn’t a production problem — demand in the U.S. was just too high. It’s a good problem to have.
Q: Component pricing?
Cook: The DRAM market is constrained.
Q: What about the iAd business? Is this a profit center?
Oppenheimer: We’re putting our toes in the water. Don’t expect much from us this calendar year. We’ll learn going forward.
Q: What about AT&T?
Cook: They continue to work hard, and are making improvements. I think this will continue. Surveys back this up.
Q: What about carriers?
Cook: There are only three main countries with exclusive deals: United States, Germany, and Spain. We’ve expanded in the others beyond one carrier and we’ve seen sales grow. But that doesn’t mean that will always happen. We look at it on a case-by-case basis.
Q: Are you open minded about iPad pricing?
Cook: We have nothing to say on that, but we’re priced very aggressively right now.
Q: Accounting for the iPad — do you defer a portion of the revenue? Charge for iPad OS updates?
Oppenheimer: We’ll discuss that on the July conference call after the iPad is out there.
Q: China updates?
Oppenheimer: Tim talked a bit about the revenue, in terms of retail stores, we’ll open 2 in Shanghai. We should have 25 open by end of 2011.
Q: Apple has been aggressive about the patents. How should we think of legal expenses?
Oppenheimer: We’ve definitely factored in legal expenses into our forward-looking numbers.
Q: Can you talk about the different ways to move the iPhone?
Cook: The smartphone market is a great market to be in. And the iPhone is outgrowing the market by 3x. The numbers are even better outside the U.S. (in terms of growth). We’ve learned a lot.
Q: About the Apple TV — what’s going on there?
Cook: Units were up 34% year over year. But it’s still very small — it’s still a hobby for the company. If you look at the other markets Apple is in — computers are 300 million units a year, call phones are 1.2 billion per year, MP3 players are 100 million per year. These are enormous markets. The market for Apple TV is not, in our view, nearly that large yet. That’s why we classify it as a hobby. Don’t want to trick people. But a number of us love the product, and use the product. We continue to think there’s something interesting there.
Q: More about iAds?
Oppenheimer: As I commented earlier, we’re just putting our toes in the water now.
Q: iPad cannibalization of the Mac?
Cook: So far there’s nothing pointing to that yet. But we don’t know yet, it’s too early. Remember, we just announced new MacBook Pros too. With the iPad in terms of netbooks — to me it’s a no brainer. “It’s sort of 100 to 0. I can’t think of a single thing a netbook does well.”
Q: But there’s no category for the iPad market yet, right?
Cook: I think Steve set this up well in January. The iPad is between the mobile phone and a notebook. There is so much you can do on an iPad. We already have the ecosystem with the App Store. Now we have a bigger canvas.
Q: What about the iPhone price? Should there be lower service plans?
Cook: We do everything that we can to try and get the best deal possible for the consumer. I feel like each of our carrier partners agree. When we dropped the iPhone 3G to $99, we were sort of surprised that so many people were still spending $199 for the iPhone 3GS. People want extremely innovative products.
Q: Margins for iPads — what about accessories?
Oppenheimer: The accessory portfolio is good for us. Many of iPhone and iPod accessories work with the iPad too. Let’s give it a little time, great things will happen.
Q: Any insight into iPad apps?
Oppenheimer: We’re not focused on making a lot of money on the App Store — with the iPad or iPhone. We’re just above break-even.
Q: Are there completely new Apple customers just from the iPad?
Cook: I think so, but it’s too early to tell.
Q: Other products in the pipeline? Are those enhancements?
Oppenheimer: We’re not going to help our competitors, so I won’t answer that. But we’re very excited about upcoming products.
That’s a wrap.

Chicago-based Groupon is certainly one heck of a startup. Like Zynga it sort of came out of nowhere in 2009. Even last December I was sort of only vaguely aware of how fast it was growing.
But it was clear by early 2010 to the whole world that Groupon was on a tear. First a round valuing it at $250 million. Then just a couple of months later it raised new money at a $1.35 billion valuation.
And then in the last few weeks Yahoo offered something even higher for the company – between $1.7 billion on the low side and probably $4 billion on the high side. And Groupon passed.
Revenues are in the $50 million per month range, and the company has roughly 50% gross margins. By some measures, Groupon is the fastest growing company, ever.
Groupon is often said to be the next eBay at Silicon Valley insider dinners and events. But Groupon isn’t going to have the same success eBay has had.
At first blush it seems like a valid comparison. Groupon’s revenues and profits blow the early Ebay results out of the water. When eBay was three years old and going public in 1998 it had revenues of just $4.7 million. Groupon does that much in revenue every three days or so right now.
Today eBay has revenues of a little over $2 billion every three months and is worth around $30 billion. It’s not at all unreasonable to think that Groupon could eventually grow its revenues way beyond $2 billion/quarter – the local products and services category would easily bear that kind of fruit.
But there’s a couple of problems with Groupon. The first is how it scales – it needs a lot of sales people for each market it handles and already probably has more than 2,000 of them on payroll. But the real problem is the complete lack of a network effect to protect its business.
Ebay is expensive. And it has a horrible user interface. Buying stuff is a pain compared with sites like Amazon that have put real effort into making buying painless. It’s also expensive. Everyone would love a better eBay, but after ten years of people trying to kill it, it just keeps going.
Why? Because everyone’s already on eBay. And every new buyer or seller makes eBay more valuable than it was before. Anyone competing with them has to find a way to counter that, and it’s nearly impossible. Even free listings from big companies like Amazon and Yahoo flailed dramatically.
In other words, eBay would have to really work at it to destroy its core business. And since it dominates the market it can continue to charge exorbitant fees and not worry about the user experience.
Groupon has none of that. When Groupon gets a new user that’s great. But that user will quickly leave to Living Social or One Kings Lane or any of thousands of other competing sites for better deals. And when Groupon gets a new “seller,” there’s no reason why that seller won’t also go try out the competitors, too.
There’s just no network effect in Groupon’s business model. Which means competitors can flourish and margins will get crushed.
At TechCrunch Disrupt, Benchmark Capital’s Matt Cohler said he wasn’t sure if Groupon would succeed over the long term. I asked him if he wished he was an investor in Groupon:
That question keeps me up at night. the question for me is…if you look at it from a purely academic point of view, there are neither barriers to entry nor are there switching costs in that product. Typically when a product has those characteristics margins tend to collapse over time. In theory the only thing stopping that from happening is Groupon’s brand…It may turn out that daily deals are ad units, and lots of different products can apply that ad unit.
What can Groupon do to avoid having their margins crushed by competitors? Establish generous revenue sharing relationships with distribution partners, fast. And that appears to be exactly what they’re doing. In the next several weeks the company will likely announce partnerships with Yahoo and CitySearch, we’ve learned.
Oh, and one more partner, too. And that partner will be…eBay.
Update: Great email comment from Alex Rampell:
I actually think Groupon is a “winner take most” market and not winner take all.  Amazon has a plurality yet a distinct minority of ecommerce share ($25B in 2009 revenue out of WW ecommerce rev of $600B) yet has a market cap of $74B, 2.5X that of eBay.  No barriers to entry.
There are no barriers to entry for online commerce companies — yet Amazon keeps decimating the competition.  There are, however, economies of scale.  I think Groupon can be the Amazon of Online2Offline commerce, and there’s no reason they can’t get to $25B in annualized revenue like Amazon, but at a much higher margin.
Whether they’ll command the same kind of earnings multiple as Amazon is another story.

Groupalia, a Spanish group buying site, has raised 5 million euros in its second institutional round after securing 2.5 million euros back in May.
Again, the funding comes from Nauta Capital, and Caixa Capital Risc, Spanish bank la Caixa’s venture capital division.
Previous angel investors also participated in the round, namely Groupalia CEO Joaquin Engel in tandem with Lucas Carné and Jose Manuel Villanueva (the founders of Privalia, another Nauta portfolio company).
Groupalia is a site that features a daily deal, in the form of a discount coupon, on the best things to do, see, eat and buy in the cities where it is present.
The company says the extra capital will be used for its planned expansions in Latin America and Southern Europe in the forthcoming months, and to help consolidate its business in the countries where it already has a presence: Spain, Italy, Brazil, Mexico and Argentina.
Its stated goals for 2010 is to attract 2 million users (it boasts 1 million today) and reach turnover of five million euros. Groupalia has 100 employees.
Great and superb buyers…
nice info…..
Despite all the hype surrounding the company, it is not surprising that a web based retail company is burining cash during a recession.  The growth plans sound sceptical…..
Is a Catalan Group!
@eRu

You donât need to look any further than Appleâs stock price over the past several months to know that theyâre on a roll. A year ago, the stock price was at about $190 a share. Today, it closed at $317.93 a share â an all-time high. In fact, theyâve hit several all-time highs this month alone. Their market cap is quickly approach $300 billion. And now the company has just announced their Q4 earnings. And once again â boom. But a boom with a couple caveats.
Just as with last quarter, AppleÂ easilyÂ beat the earnings estimates. The company posted $20.34 billion in revenue and $4.31 billion in profit â both new records for Apple. EPS was $4.64 (Wall Street consensus had been $4.06 and Appleâs guidance had been $3.44). A year ago, Apple posted revenue of $12.21 billion with a profit of $2.53 billion ($2.77 EPS). All that said, gross margin did drop a bit, to 36.9 percent down from 41.8 percent a year ago.
The key product numbers:Â 3.89 million Macs during the quarter, 14.1 million iPhones, 9.05 million iPods, and 4.19 million iPads. Aside from iPods, each of those is a new record for the company. The number of iPhones sold is probably the most amazing stat there. As CEO Steve Jobs very specifically notes in the PR, Apple sold 2 million more iPhones last quarter than RIM sold BlackBerry devices. He also notes that âwe still have a few surprises left for the remainder of this calendar yearâ â *cough* Wednesday *cough*
Given how quickly the iPad sold out of the gate (3.27 million in the first quarter it was available), the 4.19 million may seem a little low. But that also means Apple sold more iPads than Macs for the first time â and again, it only took two quarters ofÂ existenceÂ to do that.
More:
The earnings call will be starting at 2 PM PT. Weâll take notes live below (paraphrased):
Peter Oppenheimer, CFO:
Steve Jobs, CEO:
Q&A
Q: How are constraints on iPad now?
Tim Cook, COO: Weâre in good shape now. We have new partners and inventory for the upcoming holiday quarter.
Q: What are the headwinds on gross margins?
PO: We did say we thought there would be some â but we did better than we thought. iPhone sales were huge.
Q: Steve, talk about the iPad opportunity. What do you think of this business a year or two years down the road?
SJ: âThe iPad is clearly going to affect notebook computers.â I think the iPad proves itâs not a question of âifâ but a question of âwhenâ. Things will continue to change over the next few years. Itâs surprising how much interest there is in business. âItâs being grabbed out of our hands.â From board rooms to nurses and doctors and hospitals. âThe more time that passes, the more I am convinced that we have a tiger by the tail here.â This is a new model of computing that we already have people trained on thanks to the iPhone.
Q: Will this be the second biggest business (behind iPhone)?
SJ: I canât predict. Weâre already shipping more of them than Macs though.
Q: Any updates on Flash?
SJ: Flash memory? We love flash memory (laughs).
Q: How is iPad supply/demand.
TC: It has been extraordinary, I canât predict when weâll be able to meet demand. iPhone 4 took iPhone demand to a whole new level too.
Q: You are the tablet market right now. Can Apple sustain share growth for tablets?
SJ: I have a hard time envisioning what competitors strategies are. They canât match us in price. Flash hasnât presented any problem at all. Most of the video on the web is now in HTML5. Weâre out to win this one. And weâre not done yet.
Q: Are smartphones a zero-sum game?
SJ: Most phones in the world are still non-smartphones. Those will convert to smartphones. There will be room for a number of companies to be successful. Right now itâs a battle for developers. And the mindshare of customers. âRight now iPhone and Android are winning that battle.â
Q: Why are margins going down?
PO: Itâs a higher than expected mix of new iPods and more iPad sales â pricing is very aggressive.
Q: How is your hobby doing? Apple TV.
SJ: We donât talk about unannounced products, but Iâm happy to talk about Apple TV. We have gone to a streaming model â itâs complete streaming. Soon to be streamed from your iPhone and iPad too with AirPlay. I can report in a short amount of time weâve already sold a quarter million. Over 250,000. Itâs a great product and its 99 price point is very enticing.
Q: What about the market share play for the iPhone?
SJ: Our goal is to make the best product â not to be the biggest. Nokia is the biggest. Theyâre good at that. We donât want to be them, we want to be like us and make the best products. In our part of the market, Android is our biggest competitor. TheyÂ out-shippedÂ us in the June quarter while we were gearing up for iPhone 4. The numbers are out yet for last quarter, but weâll see how we did. âWe donât know how to make a great smartphone for $50.â
Q: What about the tablet competition?
SJ: The reason we wouldnât make a 7-inch tablet isnât because we wouldnât want to hit a certain price point, we just think itâs too small for the software.
Q: With over $50 billion in cash now, what about returning money to shareholders?
SJ: We believe there are one or more strategic opportunities that may come along. And with the cash we have, we can do something. The money isnât burning a hole in our pockets, weâve been smart with it. Weâd like to continue to keep our powder dry. There are one or more strategic opportunities in the future.
Q: What about other carriers for the iPhone? A lot of pressure there?
TC: The pressure is really only on the supply. Everyone weâre doing business with wants more supply. Thatâs the pressure I feel.
Q: Why do you think you have an advantage on the price point with the iPad?
SJ: Part of it is that we engineered so much of it ourselves. We did the A4 chip. And we learned a lot from the iPod and iPhones. Others have to buy things on the market with middlemen, who take a cut. Weâre efficient. This is a product weâve been training for for the past decade.
Thatâs a wrap.

[Luxembourg] Jamendo, a community of free, legal music published with Creative Commons licenses, is actively looking to sell to or merge with another company, TechCrunch Europe has learned. Jamendo CEO Laurent Kratz has confirmed rumors that had made their way to Twitter earlier this week.
The reason is fairly simple: Jamendo is running out of money after failing to raise a follow-up round of venture capital. The startup was looking to raise 1.5 million euros (roughly $2.15 million) after securing a ‘significant amount’ in Series A funding back in June 2007. The company failed to come to an agreement with Mangrove Capital Partners, its original backer, and a potential new investor.
Kratz tells us Jamendo for the past 18 months has been frantically setting up a unique infrastructure for the promotion and the monetization of Creative Commons Music, building a vast catalog of music (200.000 tracks, give or take) along with the needed technical infrastructure and legal environment for such a venture to make waves.
In March 2009, the startup debuted an online shop where music licenses for multimedia projects (think film, tv shows, documentary, DVD, promotional video, websites, etc.) and background music for shops, restaurants, hotels and so on could be purchased. Kratz dubs Jamendo a ‘Fotolia for music’ based on that positioning.
For context: artists use the service to voluntarily allow anyone to share, download or stream their music for free or in exchange for 50% of royalties, and Jamendo doesn’t impose any usage limits upon users (for which it is loved). This goes beyond what stock music and sound effects providers like for instance AudioMicro and indie music distributors like Magnatune currently offer.
Jamendo says it has attracted around 2300 paying customers since the launch of the online store, bringing it to a turnover of over 300,000 euros in 2009 with a gross margin of 50%.
Kratz informed me that the startup, along with majority stakeholder Mangrove Capital Partners, has already engaged in talks over a potential sale or merger, although he didn’t want to name names. There are lots of suitors I can think of, but that is no guarantee a sale will follow.
We’ll keep you posted on where Jamendo ultimately ends up: under the wings of another company or in the deadpool.

Had to retweet this
This is too bad! I hope they don’t end up in the deadpool.
Personnally I think Jamando can or could be a good competitor in europe (at least in France where I use it).
For a while (begining of last year) I did replace it by deezer, because of the wonderfull gui deezer used to have.
But today I think Jamando progressed in gui (and also Deezer’s recent gui is surprisingly worste than previous one)
I just can not GET why Mangrove does not back it.
At least on this startup, I really have the feeling they made a good choice.
new  used it stop using jile I think
yeah thats a real shame.  Fingers crossed they don’t end up in the deadpool – its sh*te whenever a startup doesn’t make it.
*sigh*
That is a shame. I hope Jamendo survives. It’s given a lot of fun (and even some cash) to a lot of musicians and music fans. Creative Commons music needs a site like Jamendo.
CTW
CC has other sites.
They don’t need VC funded sites – CC itself was a grassroots movement by artists for artists… (here comes the plug…) which is what http://www.sectionz.com is for musicians, and we have CC licensing built into our site
.. . and although it kinda looks like shite atm the site is weeks away from the first new build in years.
http://sutros.com is another site that supports cc. Built by love, it doesn’t need crazy vc money to keep it running…
Just thought I should chip in that SoundCloud – http://soundcloud.com – has Creative Commons support too and is rapidly becoming one of the first places for an artist to upload their music on the web. (disclosure: I work at SoundCloud).
Anyone see on the site where they are asking for donations? Wikipedia does it all the time. Not sure why they don’t do the same.
They dont, operating costs are ad supported, any money you donate is given to the artists minus a .5 euro transaction fee.
http://www.sectionz.com –
– longest running music community online (pre-2000)
 – free
 – not VC funded and weeks away from a sweet new ruby build being launched.
– owners, devs and admins are all active community members and 100% volunteers.
grassroots wins in the long run
keep us in your favs & watch for the new build very soon.
And, the innovative out of the box concepts such as SEMG.09 can never be found elsewhere, for its the musicians playground and they choose the game they want to play!
Since the era of MP3.com… roots back to 1997, SectionZ rocks !!
Jamendo is awesome, I’d be sad to see it go. I discovered Chronique, which is now one of my favorite bands, on there.
Let’s hope someone acquires it without changing too much.
Commercial users of music, in our experience, are not interested in a creative commons license.  The licensing model works for us, so my guess is that the costs of upkeeping their site was just too much – they could probably stick around if they get rid of some fat.  Are the hosted / stored in the cloud?  Where does all the burn go?  Jamendo – we’d love to hear from you.
TBH, I won’t miss Jamendo! Through all the years of their existence they only got better in ignoring the community. All constructive critics were completly ignored and sometimes you even didn’t have an administrator who speaks your language (only french). Sometimes it took days to inform anyone that they added a full album with copyrighted music. In my opinion they never really cared about the community (only as content producers) – at least they didn’t communicate with the musicians and users.
Does anybody know the first Jamendo orange? They only brought bugs and removed a lot of the old features when updating the site to Jamendo blue and the actual Jamendo orange.
WOW. With that insight, seriously, I want you all to have a look at SectionZ! :-)
You said it so right, the lack of communication or of active involvement makes no point of existence for any community. And that’s why SectionZ is what it has always been!
Admins / owners themselves are musicians! Voila. ;)
Eagerly awaiting its new beta build. :)

Bonjour,
Jamendo existe depuis pratiquement 6 ans, c’est devenu le site n°1 de la musique libre sous licences CC. Jamendo c’est la liberté d’écouter, de télécharger, de choisir de donner directement aux artistes.
Jamendo connait une période difficile dû en partie à la conjoncture économique actuelle. Aujourd’hui nous avons l’occasion de soutenir Jamendo pour pouvoir continuer à en profiter. Pour cela :
1) Faites un don, même modeste (2€, 5€, 10€, 20€, ou plus), ici : http://www.jamendo.com/fr/artist/supportjamendo/shop (bouton : “Faire un don…”)
2) Buzzez sur internet, parlez-en à vos amis, utilisez vos réseaux sociaux, laisser des commentaires sur des sites comme Deezer, sur vos blogs préférés, etc. Parlez de Jamendo, insistez sur le téléchargement libre et légal, sur le partage. N’oubliez-pas de laisser des liens.
3) Faites tourner ce message, envoyez-le à vos amis Jamendo et encouragez-les à faire pareil.
Pour les mois à venir, des idées germent comme un système d’abonnement à l’année pour les artistes souhaitant diffuser en HD leurs albums (en plus de la diffusion « classique » qui resterait gratuite pour tous). Toutes les idées sont bonnes à prendre.
Pour plus d’informations et en débattre, voici la discussion (forum francophone) : http://www.jamendo.com/fr/forums/discussion/32290/
C’est peu, mais déjà beaucoup ;)

Hello,
Jamendo has been almost 6 years, it became the No. 1 site for free music under CC licenses. Jamendo is the freedom to listen, download, choose to give directly to artists.
Jamendo knows a difficult period due in part to current economic conditions. Today we have the opportunity to support Jamendo to continue to enjoy. To do this:
1) Make a donation, however modest (2 €, 5 €, 10 €, 20 € or more) here: http://www.jamendo.com/fr/artist/supportjamendo/shop (button: “Add Don …”)

3) Rotate this message, send it to your friends Jamendo and encourage them to do the same.
For months, ideas germinate as a system of annual subscription for artists wishing to distribute their albums in HD (in addition to circulating “classic” that would remain free for all). All ideas are good to take.
For more information and debate, here is the discussion (french forum): http://www.jamendo.com/fr/forums/discussion/32290/ & (english forum : http://www.jamendo.com/en/forums/discussion/10373/how-can-we-help-save-jamendo/#Item_0)

Apple has just announced its Q1 2010 earnings, and as expected, they’re very good. I’ll get to the numbers in a second, but perhaps more notable are two Steve Jobs quotes in the release:
“If you annualize our quarterly revenue, it’s surprising that Apple is now a $50+ billion company.”
and
“The new products we are planning to release this year are very strong, starting this week with a major new product that we’re really excited about.”
I think we all know what that means.
In terms of the financials for the quarter itself, Apple continued strong momentum in terms of Mac and iPhone sales, while iPod sales continued to slip. The iPhone numbers are the most impressive: 8.7 million iPhones in the quarter, a 100 percent unit growth over the year-ago quarter — and up 17.6 percent from the previous quarter. Meanwhile, Apple sold 3.36 million Macs, which was a 33 percent increase over the year-ago period. iPod sales totaled 21 million, which was down 8 percent versus a year ago.
Overall, the company posted revenue of $15.68 billion and a net profit of $3.38 billion. That means revenue was up about $4 billion versus a year ago, while profit was up over $1 billion. Gross margin was 40.9 percent, up from 37.9 percent a year ago.
Apple also notes that it has gained another $5.8 billion in cash for the quarter, which should push its war chest very close to $40 billion.
Also noteworthy is that Apple decided to start adopting the new accounting principles for subscription devices such as the iPhone and Apple TV this quarter. During last quarter’s conference call, Apple noted that it wasn’t sure when it would start doing that, saying that it only had to by the end of the year. But with this new method in place, it “significantly changes” how Apple reports its numbers.
Below find my conference call live notes (paraphrased):
On the call: Apple CFO Peter Oppenheimer, Apple COO Tim Cook, as well as Apple’s Treasurer.

Tesla has released the details of their 2010 Q2 financial performance, and it looks like things are coming up roses kind of sucking for the nascent auto maker. Sales are up, with nearly $27m in sales coming in — translating to a total of around 250 Roadsters shipped. Their gross margins are up, though; their business is growing, and hopefully cash on hand will suffice to pay for R&D and manufacturing until they start eking out a profit.
Update: We must also note that their second-quarter loss grew to $38.5 million. The stock fell $1.15 on the news yesterday. Any loss this great is, of course, undesirable, but Tesla has made it clear that they do not expect to make a profit until the Model S is selling.
Critically, the launch of the Model S sedan is on track, and much of the cost of development is already behind them. With a far lower price and larger target demographic, it is likely the first Tesla car many will actually see on the road, and not parked in some entrepreneur’s driveway in Mountain View. Meanwhile, the Roadster 2.5 will likely boost sales a bit, but it’s not really a bottom-line item right now.
At $57K for a base price, it has no immediate competition; without tax credit, the Volt is at $41K and the Leaf at $32K — but to be honest, they are completely different vehicles and completely different markets. Sales of the Roadster are a poor indicator for potential in the the eco-conscious upper-middle-class urbanite market, but with luck Tesla can take their time.
Other highlights of the quarter:
More information, including a breakdown of the actual numbers, can be found here. Tesla’s stock closed today at $21.26, down $0.69/3.1%.

Intel has just bought computer and software security company McAfee according to a release issued this morning. The all cash deal is worth $7.68 billion, or $48 per share. See the release below.
According the statement issued by Intel, McAfee will continue to operate as a wholly-owned subsidiary, reporting into Intel’s Software and Services Group. Intel says the “acquisition enables a combination of security software and hardware from one company to ultimately better protect consumers, corporations and governments as billions of devices – and the server and cloud networks that manage them – go online.”
McAfee is one of the largest security technology companies  in the world and saw $2 billion in revenue in 2009. Cyber security, whether it be on computers or mobile devices, is a lucrative business as internet use is on the rise. And McAfee also offers smartphone security software, through the recent acquisitions of Trust Digital and TenCube. Clearly, Intel wants a piece of the pie.
In fact, in the release, Intel’s president and CEO Paul Otellin called security the “third pillar of what people demand from all computing experiences,” behind energy-efficient performance and connectivity.
Intel also just acquired Texas Instruments’ cable modem product line.
Intel Corporation has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire McAfee, Inc., through the purchase of all of the company’s common stock at $48 per share in cash, for approximately $7.68 billion. Both boards of directors have unanimously approved the deal, which is expected to close after McAfee shareholder approval, regulatory clearances and other customary conditions specified in the agreement.
“In the past, energy-efficient performance and connectivity have defined computing requirements. Looking forward, security will join those as a third pillar of what people demand from all computing experiences.”
The acquisition reflects that security is now a fundamental component of online computing. Today’s security approach does not fully address the billions of new Internet-ready devices connecting, including mobile and wireless devices, TVs, cars, medical devices and ATM machines as well as the accompanying surge in cyber threats. Providing protection to a diverse online world requires a fundamentally new approach involving software, hardware and services.
Inside Intel, the company has elevated the priority of security to be on par with its strategic focus areas in energy-efficient performance and Internet connectivity.
McAfee, which has enjoyed double-digit, year-over-year growth and nearly 80 percent gross margins last year, will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Intel, reporting into Intel’s Software and Services Group. The group is managed by Renée James, Intel senior vice president, and general manager of the group.
“With the rapid expansion of growth across a vast array of Internet-connected devices, more and more of the elements of our lives have moved online,” said Paul Otellini, Intel president and CEO. “In the past, energy-efficient performance and connectivity have defined computing requirements. Looking forward, security will join those as a third pillar of what people demand from all computing experiences.
“The addition of McAfee products and technologies into the Intel computing portfolio brings us incredibly talented people with a track record of delivering security innovations, products and services that the industry and consumers trust to make connecting to the Internet safer and more secure,” Otellini added.
“Hardware-enhanced security will lead to breakthroughs in effectively countering the increasingly sophisticated threats of today and tomorrow,” said James. “This acquisition is consistent with our software and services strategy to deliver an outstanding computing experience in fast-growing business areas, especially around the move to wireless mobility.”
“McAfee is the next step in this strategy, and the right security partner for us,” she added. “Our current work together has impressive prospects, and we look forward to introducing a product from our strategic partnership next year.”
“The cyber threat landscape has changed dramatically over the past few years, with millions of new threats appearing every month,” said Dave DeWalt, president and CEO of McAfee. “We believe this acquisition will result in our ability to deliver a safer, more secure and trusted Internet-enabled device experience.”
McAfee, based in Santa Clara and founded in 1987, is the world’s largest dedicated security technology company with approximately $2 billion in revenue in 2009. With approximately 6,100 employees, McAfee’s products and technologies deliver secure solutions and services to consumers, enterprises and governments around the world and include a strong sales force that works with a variety of customers.
The company has a suite of software-related security solutions, including end-point and networking products and services that are focused on helping to ensure Internet-connected devices and networks are protected from malicious content, phony requests and unsecured transactions and communications. Among others, products include McAfee Total Protection™, McAfee Antivirus, McAfee Internet Security, McAfee Firewall, McAfee IPS as well as an expanding line of products targeting mobile devices such as smartphones.
Intel has made a series of recent and successful software acquisitions to pursue a deliberate strategy focused on leading companies in their industry delivering software that takes advantage of silicon. These include gaming, visual computing, embedded device and machine software and now security.
Home to two of the most innovative labs and research in the high-tech industry, Intel and McAfee will also jointly explore future product concepts to further strengthen security in the cloud network and myriad of computers and devices people use in their everyday lives.
On a GAAP basis, Intel expects the combination to be slightly dilutive to earnings in the first year of operations and approximately flat in the second year. On a non-GAAP basis, excluding a one-time write down of deferred revenue when the transaction closes and amortization of acquired intangibles, Intel expects the combination to be slightly accretive in the first year and improve beyond that.

On Friday at our Social Currency CrunchUp, Groupon CEO Andrew Mason sat down for an interview with our own Michael Arrington and Erick Schonfeld. Mason touched on Groupon’s history — including some dabbling with slippers with flashlights, and also gave some insight into the company’s growth as well as his view on the competition.
During the interview, Michael revealed that he’d heard that Groupon was generating $1 million in revenue a day — Mason played coy and didn’t appear to confirm this.  However, he did acknowledge that the company is getting a gross margin of 50% or higher, going on to say “it’s a cool business”.
It’s safe to say that Mason, at least publicly, isn’t overly concerned about Groupon’s potential competition. Asked about the possible entry of Google into the market, Mason facetiously responded, “Google, Oh My God!”.  And Mason said that Amazon (and Woot, which it recently acquired) were primarily focused on consumer products, while Groupon caters more to local businesses.
Asked about Tippr, which acquired a number of patents relevant to this space, Mason said that Groupon has “had people look at us to see if [the patents] applied and they don’t.” Mason also doesn’t worry much about clones — the company started seeing them pop up in March 2009, but Groupon doesn’t actively do anything about them because “the basic idea of Groupon is not something we can patent” (though they do go after companies that infringe on its trademarks, like its logo).
Other key stats Mason talked about:
Asked about advertising on Facebook versus Google, Mason said that six months ago Facebook was often cheaper.  However, that’s changing.  Mason explained that in the past, when he wasn’t really focused on the Silicon Valley scene, he would look at Facebook’s valuations and not really see how it could warrant them — but now that he’s an advertiser on Facebook, he thinks “they’re going to be worth a lot of money”.

Marlin Equity Partners, a Los Angeles-based private investment firm with over $1 billion of capital under management, has agreed to acquire all outstanding shares of core systems software company Phoenix Technologies common stock for $3.85 per share in cash, or approximately $139 million in total consideration.
The purchase price represents a premium of approximately 27% over Phoenix’s closing share price of $3.02 on August 17. The company is listed on NASDAQ under the symbol PTEC.
The agreement was unanimously approved by Phoenix’s board of directors and is expected to close before year’s end, provided the transaction meets customary closing conditions as well as the approval of the company’s stockholders.
Thirty years ago, Phoenix’s core systems software helped launch the PC industry with its original BIOS product. A majority of Phoenix Technologies’ revenue still comes from designing, developing, and supporting core system software such as SecureCore Tiano, SecureCore, and Embedded BIOS for computing devices.
The company’s total revenues from continuing operations for the third quarter of fiscal 2010 ended June 30, 2010 were $13.7 million. Gross margin from continuing operations for the third quarter of fiscal 2010 was $11.4 million.

Preparing for an eventual public offering, Skype has now filed an IPO registration statement with the SEC. The maximum proposed offering amount is listed as $100 million, but that is just a placeholder amount.
According to the filing, Skype’s revenues for the first six months of 2010 were $406 million, with a net income of only $13 million.  But a big portion of that was from interest income. That is only a 3 percent net margin, and this isn’t exactly a new business.  Its income from operations was only $1.4 million for the six months.  However, its gross margins are 51 percent, and have been expanding steadily as the company benefits from the scale of is operations and is able to negotiate lower telephone termination fees around the world.
On the IPO road show, Skype will no doubt point to its adjusted EBITDA (earnings before income taxes and depreciation) numbers, which conveniently strip out things like goodwill, stock-based compensation and litigation expenses.  Adjusted EBITDA for the first half of 2010 was $115.7 million, up 54 percent from a year ago.  The company currently has $85 million in cash.  These numbers reflect pro forma adjustments to Skype’s historical financial statements.  (Click on the financial results table below to enlarge):

One interesting tidbit from the filing is that Skype had to pay $344 million to settle with the Skype founders for the Joltid peer-to-peer technology that at one point threatened to hold up the spin-off of Skype from eBay.
The filing also reveals that Skype “users made 95 billion minutes of voice and video calls” during the first half of 2010, with a full 40 percent of those minutes being video.  Skype users also sent 84 million SMS text messages through Skype during the period.
As of June 30, Skype was averaging 124 million users a month, with only 8.1 million of those paying users (out of a total of 560 million registered users).  Those users, however, pay an average of $96 a year.  Skype’s strategy is to keep growing its overall number of users and convert more of them to paying customers.
Getting more people to buy Skype-Out minutes will obviously not be sufficient.  Skype also plans on adding advertising revenues and enterprise products (37 percent of users surveyed say they use Skype for business purposes).  According to the filing, part of Skype’s strategy will be to:
Develop new monetization models, including advertising. Our users made over 152 billion minutes of Skype-to-Skype calls in the twelve months ended June 30, 2010. We believe this represents a meaningful opportunity to increase our revenue from alternative monetization models, including advertising, gaming and virtual gifts.
The company is based in Luxemborg and is offering American depository shares.  A new holding company will be created following the offering which will combine the ownership from public investors, private investors such as Silver Lake Partners and Andreessen Horowitz, and employees.  The convoluted chart below shows what the new ownership structure will look like:

Local cost-per-click marketplace Reply.com wants to raise $60 million in an initial public offering.  The company filed its offering statement with the SEC this morning.
Reply.com is a cost-per-click ad network which targets ads for local businesses.  Its strategy is to gather more information from consumers who click on their ads by inserting a “middle page” between that pops to ask them where they live or what brands they like to improve targeting before showing them an ad.
Revenues rose 75 percent in 2009 to $32.6 million.  The company operates with a 50 percent gross margin, and turned its first net profit in 2009 of $2.5 million.  The business produced $4.7 million in cash flow in 2009, but it ended the year with only $1.3 million in cash.  Reply.com acquires click traffic from search engines, display ad networks, and other sources.  These traffic acquisition costs account for nearly all of its cost of revenue.  In the fourth quarter alone, the generated 4.9 million “enhanced clicks” and 700,000 leads for 5,000 advertisers. The company employs 127 people—103 of them in sales and marketing.
Since 2005, the company has raised $27.5 million from Scale Venture Partners, Outlook Ventures, ATEL Ventures, and Debi Coleman, a former CFO of Apple.  CEO Payam Zamani is the largest stockholder.  He owns 43 percent of shares outstanding (before the offering).  Scale is the second largest shareholder, with 21.5 percent.
Zamani was previously the co-founder of Autoweb, and he’s been bankrolling the Reply.com.  Over the past two years, the company has been dipping into his personal lines of credit to improve its liquidity.  According to the filing, the “aggregate principal amount that we repaid under these credit lines to Mr. Zamani through December 31, 2009 was $5.9 million.”  All of this personal debt to the CEO was repaid as of December 31, 2009, but it does suggest one reason why the company may need more working capital.  It also plans to use the proceeds to expand into new advertising categories and geographies (and, presumably, to hire more sales people—local ad plays are very sales intensive).

Garmin is expecting ’08 to be a banner year despite the piss-poor economy. When all the beans are counted and the ducks are lined up, the largest GPS manufacturer expects to haveshipped 50% more GPS units this year verse in previous years.
If Garmin does hit that 50% more figure, that would result in the firm shipping out over 18 million GPS devices. This is despite that fact that other GPS makers are throwing in the towel and people are losing their homes. Apparently, none of that matters for Garmin. The company had a great Black Friday weekend and expects the trend to continue through the end of the holiday spending blitz. Maybe the extra revenue from these high sales will guarantee  that the Android-powered Garmin smartphone will launch on time and actually mainstream ready.
Update: So yeah, Garmin isn’t too happy with Digitime for releasing that number. So much so that they have issued a press release disputing the report. While the PR doesn’t deny anything explicitly, it does cast a shadow of doubt. Who cares though. In the end, Garmin shipped a crapton of GPS’s; end of story.
CAYMAN ISLANDS–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Garmin Ltd. (NASDAQ: GRMN), the global leader in satellite navigation, is disputing a Monday, December 22 report in the DigiTimes trade publication entitled, “Garmin expects to ship 18 million GPS PNDs in 2008.” The story contains a number of inaccuracies in both sales figures and product rollout schedules.
“Black Friday sales from our customers were what we expected and gross margins remain relatively strong,” said Kevin Rauckman, Garmin’s CFO and treasurer. “However, the December sales environment is weaker, which we attribute to our retail customers’ desire to exit the year with lower levels of inventory.”
As is customary, Garmin will update investors during its fourth quarter 2008 earnings call, scheduled for February 25, 2009.

“It seems apparent that content will cost us more,” McCarthy said. “Whether we raise prices will be entirely a function of churn, subscriber acquisition costs and gross margins.”

Betnow, a London-based mobile gambling service, has won a healthy first round of funding (specific amount undisclosed) from Balderton Capital and angel investors. Betnow allows users to text SMS messages to 89808 and place bets on football, golf, horse racing, dog racing and tennis matches in plain English. The bet is interpreted by a natural language engine, while most mobile gambling portals are WAP or Java based (e.g. Ladbrokes). This means placing a Betnow bet will likely be even easier and faster than normal. Payment is via the mobile contract ora bank account with winnings collected from a customer’s local Post Office branch. Balderton’s portfolio also includes Betfair, Bebo and Zopa. The founders are Vodafone veterans Robert Urwin and Mike McCartney plus former Home Office IT developer Malcolm Slater.
A Juniper Research white paper released in October put mobile gambling as being worth $1.3 billion in 2007 and $26 billion by 2012. The UK is a hotbed of mobile gambling already, along with many other European countries where SMS services continue to boom. I couldn’t find more recent research but a study in 2005 found traffic to mobile gambling sites was rocketing in the UK by 367 per cent year on year sparking concerns about addiction.
Mike Arrington of TechCrunch US believes that Balderton may regret the investment “if the business gets a bad reputation.” This may be the case. If the technology works, Betnow could well take a sizeable chunk of the market. But if I know the UK press they will go after the government for not reigning in gambling companies or funding enough gambling addiction programmes. They probably won’t go after Betnow. Afterall, too many UK journalists like a punt as it is.
[…] UK has more on this from a local […]
Currently the mobile networks charge massive percentages for reverse/premium sms services. ie. £3.50 on your phonebill only means approx £1.80 in somebody like betnows pocket. I read somewhere that there are constant negotiations to lower this, but the networks coin so much in off it that they don’t want to (think of all that revenue they’re getting from dodgy pay per flirt sms services lol!)
I wonder if these guys (betnow) have managed to negotiate an amazing rate direct with the mobile networks, or if they’re just absolutely screwing gamblers with horrible odds?
Mike,
You’ve repeated the mistake the other Mike made: which is a bizarre assumption that ‘betting through your phone = addiction’.
I don’t completely understand Betnow’s model – as Jessie pointed out, the mobile operators will be taking a big chunk of the premium rate SMS (around 40%) which simply can’t work for sports betting that has an average gross margin of around 5-6%.
Also, the hardened sports bettor are much more likely to want to use an operators (Coral, Ladbrokes etc) own service anyway – it’s more complete and they’ve already gone through the registration process.
Interesting to see how it does though….

Joe – Incorrect, I did not repeat the view that mobile gambling leads directly to addiction, I merely pointed out that the research so far showing it’s rapid take up have sparking concerns among other observers. To clarify, my view is that UK and European users are now so used to using their mobile for a range of services, gambling is just another service that will slot into their already heavy use of the mobile. Whether an individual is pre-disposed to addictive tendencies because the mobile is generally more accessible and close to hand depends… on the individual.
Mike,
Re-read the title to your post:
‘ Betnow wins Balderton funds for text-to-bet. Addicts beware.’
Seems a pretty explicit association between mobile gambling and addiction to me.
@Joe, I agree that the title does infer this association. Which I think is wrong.
SMS is mostly going to be for casual gamers. Betnow are just making it easier for that market. Casuals are less willing to go to higher lengths to put  bet and thats what this technology will supposedly do.
I bet, maybe 4/5 times a year, and sometimes when I have a hunch, I can’t be a**ed to go to a shop, or log in to service my account. Of course, you could point out that more casual gamers could be turned into addicts, but I think that type of customer is susceptible whatever the climate.
Having said that (@Mike) your article doesn’t really go on to assert the “Beware” part or MA’s comments yesterday.
Aw, shucks you got me. I forgot about the headline! :-)
i use betnow it has a £3 per bet limited unless you register a credit card etc and there is a daily limit of £20-30 so you shouldnt get too carried away. this service seems to be for casual punter and it makes saturday afternoons more fun. it iis easy to use and seems to be fairly responsable.
Full Disclosure – I am in the UK having founded a business in the online gaming space….
One thing that Mike A doesn’t consider is that Balderton is fulfilling it’s fiduciary responsibility by investing in the businesseses it believes will produce the best return for its investors. If it raised it’s fun without specifically excluding investments in sin businesses (i.e. it wasn’t created as a socially responsible venture fund), then in fact, you could say that it is ethically wrong for the fund to not consider online gambling businesses. It is a large, fast growing market where recent UK legislation (the gambling act of 2005) has legalized online gambling and provided a great opportunity for new fast growing businesses.  Before the passing of the US unlawful internet gambling enforcement act (UIGEA), party gaming was growing their profits faster than google… If you were invested in a venture fund and hadn’t wanted to restrict their investments, but let them invest in any legal business that would bring the best return, wouldn’t you want them to invest in that business?
correction above – raised it’s “fund”… not “fun” :-)
Betnow are not the only guys in text betting market BetTec
http://www.bet-tec.com/ do the same. In addition to text betting you can also sign up for results and  Horse-Alert Service.  All bets require a pin number which makes it more secure.
Cool service, but i am old school and love to place my bets “offline” . It’s just a better feeling. In our rush to make some easy money using such technology, we actually build empires for a very very very small amount of people.
as i wrote on arrington’s post, don’t be surprised by venture capitalists investing on gambling companies, as they themselves are gamblers with their money by trading shares on “intellectual casinos” such as nasdaq and so on
Hey! Seems like you might have a good group heading on right here. I’m unable to publish anywhere else simply because my password hasn’t arrived nevertheless, but I wanted to introduce myself here in this.
Identify is Zachariah; Currently finishing up my Physics Major at OSU, and can almost certainly remain at OSU for my graduate studies. I’m a recent convert on the YEC model and I am rather enthusiastic to find out far more about it — that is why I’m right here.
I almost certainly will not submit for a week or so, as I’ll be spending my time studying all past messages attempting to get a sense for what has by now been discussed.
I look forward to debate and discussion.

I’m a little skeptical regarding these numbers but some fancy-pants financial types are estimating a $300-$500 million loss in revenue due to unlocked, non-AT&T iPhone sales. This presumes there are about 1 million units out there unlocked and unaccounted for, something I find hard to believe.
If Apple were to somehow stop the sale of unlocked iPhones (by forcing customers to activate them at the point of purchase, say) the company might miss its target of selling 10 million iPhones in 2008 — and forgo even more revenue and profit.
But if Apple does nothing, it gets hit with a double whammy. Not only are its healthy gross margins reduced (unlocked iPhones generate 50% less revenue for Apple and 70-75% less profit, according to Sacconaghi), but growing new markets overseas gets harder. If the company can’t stop the flow of unlocked iPhones into a country like China, what’s the incentive for a Chinese carrier to pay the stiff premium Apple demands for the right to be that country’s exclusive carrier?
The only real way to figure this out is to check out AnySIM and iPhoneSIMFree download stats, which I don’t believe are quite as public or accurate as they could be. In fact, 9to5mac estimated 250,000 last October and given even a brisk pace wouldn’t be even close to a million right now. It’s not FUD, per se, but it does effect the financial markets for these analysts to make these claims resulting in some ridiculous stock drops and rises.

This is a little old but it’s quite interesting. Cringely, no stranger to Apple rumors, is positing that instead of dumping Intel or changing the cafeteria to entirely vegan, Apple is planning on installing H.264 chips into all of their laptops and desktops, essentially enabling 2Mbps transfer of HD, 1080p content over iTunes. This would also enable 720p video chat in iChat and a host of other interesting improvements to Apple’s video offerings.
The basis for all of the conjecture is a comment during the July 21st Apple earnings call:
Here’s how this mess of a story got started. On Monday, July 21st Apple Chief Financial Officer Peter Oppenheimer dropped a bomb on those listening to Apple’s quarterly conference call on earnings for Wall Street analysts. He said that gross margins for the coming quarter, and possibly beyond, would be lower for three reasons: 1) a back-to-school special; 2) a one-time charge related to a contract manufacturer, and; 3) “a future product transition that I can’t discuss with you today.”

Note that he said margins would be lower, which means they’re going to be spending money in the future, not saving it by using a cheaper chipset. The H.264 chips cost about $50 to install and would essentially boost the  price of Apple gear. Because H.264 encoding and decoding on a chip could bring future revenue in terms of video sales and video editing good will, spending $50 to make some nice cash down the line doesn’t seem like a bad idea.

Apple has just released its fiscal Q3 2013 earnings — it reported $35.3 billion in revenue (slightly up 0.9 percent from $35 billion in the year-ago quarter) along with $6.9 billion in quarterly net profit (down 21.6 percent from $8.8 billion in the year-ago quarter), representing earnings of $7.47 per share. Similarly to Q2 earnings, Apple posted a year-over-year quarterly earnings decline (down 19.8 percent from EPS of $9.32).
Apple is still a money making machine, but the company’s growth has slowed. Recently, the Cupertino-based company has tweaked its release cycle a bit. Almost the entire product line was refreshed over the last three months of 2012, pumping sales for Q1 2013 and leaving a void for the rest of the year. The company seems to follow the same pattern this year, aside from the MacBook Air.
As Zach Epstein says on Twitter, Samsung is now the most profitable smartphone vendor in the world, edging Apple with its $8.9 billion in profit. Yet, Samsung recently released its flagship phone, the Galaxy S4, while the iPhone 5 was released ten months ago.
According to Bloomberg Businessweek, the consensus among analysts was for Apple to report earnings of $7.28 per share on $34.9 billion in revenue. Fortune expected nearly the same with $34.94 billion in revenue and earnings of $7.29 per share.
The company’s cash on hand slightly increased from $145 billion to $146.6 billion. It remains one of Apple’s main asset. It allows the company to spend more time experimenting and preparing new products behind the curtains without having to worry about its resources. Apple beat all of those numbers, even if it means generating less profit.
“We are especially proud of our record June quarter iPhone sales of over 31 million and the strong growth in revenue from iTunes, Software and Services,” wrote CEO Tim Cook in the earnings release. “We are really excited about the upcoming releases of iOS 7 and OS X Mavericks, and we are laser-focused and working hard on some amazing new products that we will introduce in the fall and across 2014,” he continued.
Guidance from its last earnings release forecasted between $33.5 billion and $35.5 billion in revenue and gross margin between 36 percent and 37 percent. While the company used to be shy about its guidance, this time around it was spot on — it probably won’t scare shareholders away.

Breaking out the numbers, devices sales were expectedly slow this quarter. It was the first time we’ve seen a yearly decrease in iPad sales, at 14.6 million, yet iPhone sales topped 31 million representing 20 percent growth year over year. Mac and iPod sales were slightly down both quarterly and yearly, which is something Apple seemed prepared for as its other iProducts begin to cannibalize the older series of products. Read more about this in our separate post.
Over the past few weeks, many analysts reported an industry-wide slowdown in smartphone sales. Apple keeps selling the iPhone 4 and the iPhone 4S at a lower price, and it hurts the company’s bottom line. Horace Dediu points out on Twitter that the average iPhone price is now about $580 compared to $613 last quarter. That’s one of the reasons why profit is down but revenue still up year over year.
See more charts about Apple’s no-growth quarter.
For Q4 2013, Apple’s own guidance forecasts between $34 billion and $37 billion in revenue (compared to $36 billion in Q4 2012) with a gross margin between 36 and 37 percent (a flat gross margin).
During Q2, Apple didn’t release any product and expectations were pretty low for the company. This time around, the company unveiled a few products during the traditional and long-anticipated WWDC keynote. The MacBook Air was updated as well as the Mac Pro. But the former was released only a couple of weeks before the end of the fiscal quarter that ended on June 30, while the latter doesn’t even have a release date yet.
And of course, the company hasn’t refresh the iPhone and the iPad since September and October 2012. In other words, Q3 was another quarter without any big new product. Cook hinted that it would be the case during the latest earnings call, saying that new products would come this fall. His quote in the earnings release confirms that. Apple unveiled a radically new iOS 7. It gave commentators hope that exciting new products are right around the corner. When it comes to product innovation, Q4 2013 will be decisive with long anticipated releases.
On the stock market side, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has experienced a pretty good month of July so far. After breaking under $400 a share at the end of June, shares have been trading over $420 for the last few days. Apple shares are currently trading up 4.16 percent in after-hours trading, showing that investors were satisfied with today’s earnings.

 THQ CEO Brian Farrell recently participated in a Q and A session here at the Pacific Crest Technology Leadership Forum in Vail, Colorado. While most of the focus at this particular conference is on financial performance and investing, Farrell’s session shed light on a few things that might interest gamers. 
In particular, Farrell spoke candidly about his company’s recent lackluster performance, a slew of new games coming out between now and next year, and the various challenges of developing for multiple platforms. He also dropped a tiny morsel concerning an upcoming MMO based on the Warhammer series that’s currently in development.
 

Here’s a transcript of the Q and A session that took place on August 4th, 2008 in Vail, Colorado at the Pacific Crest Technology Leadership Forum.
Q: Investors believe that the video game industry is a recession-resistant industry as a whole. Could you talk about anything you’ve seen so far inside consumer video games and do you think this is something we just grow through or is it something that keeps you up at night?
A: The video game industry is relatively recession-resistant. I think it’s fairly clear that video games offer a great consumer value for the money — you know, hours and hours of gameplay for anything from $20 to $60. So I think that’s what makes the industry somewhat recession-resistant. 
The one thing I worry about is the hardware at the higher end of the range of price points. The 360 and the PS3 are still at relatively high price points by historical standards this late in the cycle, so I think we should be a little concerned about the velocity of the hardware at those higher price points.
That being said, the last few months’ NPD data indicate that hardware sales are still fairly robust. In fact, DS and Wii at lower price points are still going very, very strongly and we’re hoping that Nintendo can for the first time actually supply [enough units to meet] full demand.
It’s a bit of a mixed bag, but the takeaway is that from our retail partners we’re really not hearing much concern about the video game sector. In fact, most of our retail partners are actually adding shelf space because this is a growing sector.
Q: You mentioned 360 and PS3. These are two boxes that, relative to our expectations, have underwhelmed in the last two years given the size of the opportunity that we all saw with the PS2 in the last cycle. What do we need to do in order to get [current generation] platforms to a market size that would be as big as something we saw in the previous cycle?
A: Remember that the original PlayStation 2’s launch price was $299. We’re not even close to that yet. So the acceleration ramp has been fairly low by historical standards. Then you’ve got the Wii, which is a tremendous value at $249. That’s really the market leader in every way. 
So our very strong view is that as we come down the price curve – and, you know, Microsoft and Sony will come down that price curve. The question is timing. When will they come down they come down the price curve? How aggressively? – but as they come down the price curve, we think you’ll see a huge acceleration in both of those platforms.
We used to always think of this industry as “the cycle” and I think the reality now is that there are several sub-cycles. There’s a sub-cycle with the DS and PSP on the handheld side. There’s a sub-cycle going on with the Wii and there’s a sub-cycle going on with the 360 and PS3. And there’s actually a sub-cycle emerging in digital and online. 
So it’s hard now to talk about “the cycle”. I think we have to talk about all the cycles, and the way we think about it at THQ is that we plan our business around each of those platforms, not around “the cycle”.
Q: Given that you’ve got all these mini-cycles building into one big cycle, what’s the cost of addressing all those? It’s clear that the cost of the price of developing for PS3 is up over PS2, but when you add in development costs for all those other opportunities, which are smaller than the one big opportunity in the last cycle, it’s driven up development costs. How do you get efficiency in that environment?
A: You make a great point. We’ve actually been saying from the beginning of this cycle that it’s all about market segmentation because, yes, to your point, what you can’t do – and we all tried to do it initially and paid the price – is take a page from the playbook saying “get a big brand, port it to three platforms, and get the efficiencies.”
Right now with the segments and the sub-cycles, you have to target the consumer where that consumer is playing. On Xbox 360 and PS3, it’s still very much of a core gamer platform. That’s why if you look at our big initiatives there – things like Saints Row 2, Red Faction: Guerilla – a real technology showpiece, Darksiders – a real artistic showpiece – you’ve got to target that high-end gamer on those systems and get the volume with that.
Wii, on the other hand, is much more of a family and kids platform. We started with mostly porting our kids titles over and the lesson we’ve learned is that it’s become much more of a family platform. So things like de Blob, which we launch in just about six weeks, is very much of a family-targeted game. Yes, the kids will want to play it but we think mom and dad will pick up the game and play with the kids.
Going to the handhelds and the sub-markets in there: DS tends to be slightly younger, so that’s more of our licensed content, whereas with PSP, we’ve had great success with our older-skewing content like WWE and our wholly-owned brand MX versus ATV.
So what we have to do – the way you find the efficiencies – is making sure you have the right product on the right platform.
Q: Gross margin question, do you have trouble making money on the Nintendo platforms? Is developing for the Wii going to structurally squeeze your gross margins or can you expand it back to the trajectory you used to be on?
A: The key to gross margins, like the key to overall success in this business, is making games that sell well. When we have a strong product line, price points maintain for a longer period of time, we show fewer markdowns and allowances to retail for products that don’t sell. The takeaway is to make games that sell.
As we’ve undertaken this very serious commitment to product quality, we’ve not had a strong release slate over the last three quarters. We think that’s about to change with the launch of de Blob, Saints Row 2, WWE, Red Faction: Guerilla, Darksiders, and UFC. So our product slate in front of us, we believe those are all products capable of commanding premium price points, which will drive gross margins.
The gross margins on the Wii, particularly for something like de Blob — $49.99 price point, very moderate development cost – those should be very, very good. Even on the budget side of the Wii, we’ve had terrific success with a product called Big Beach Sports primarily in Europe – budget title, but very low development cost, so those margins are good.
Again, the common theme is that if you make hits, you make money. If you don’t make hits, your margins are compressed.
Q: How important is owned IP versus licensed IP?
A: Our strategy is a balance. We’d love to see around 50-50 owned IP to licensed IP. We love the licensed IP business – predic
table brand, lots of cross-promotion opportunities, relatively stable cash flows – so we like that predictability. Things like WWE and UFC, because they add new fight modes and new characters, you can annualize those and you don’t wear out the brand. We’ve signed recent deals with Marvel and Dreamworks, and the first UFC products are coming. So we’re still going to be very active in that category.
That being said, huge value creation comes from owned IP. You can sequel it, you can extend the brand, you can take it to other media. It is riskier, so that’s why we like the balance. It kind of lowers the overall beta, if you will. We want one to three new IP’s per year, plus sequels and extending some of our other brands. That, going along with our licensed portfolio, we think combines both some sustainability and predictability. 
As displeased as I am right now with our recent performance, we have grown for thirteen consecutive years in a very cyclical industry. So I think our strategy is right. Where we’re really focused right now is making sure we execute on the product side because not only will we get the revenue growth, we’ll get the margin growth.
Q: What’s the price point that you think will really ramp console sales? Is $199 still the magic number or is it different now? Because there are so many other platforms that people are playing games on – cell phones, PSP, DS, potentially the iPhone.
A: Really good question. Historically, getting below $199 and even $149 was always crucial to getting to that mass market. I think that price point is probably slightly higher than that right now. I think a sub $200 price point or even sub $249 can be very powerful.
As you know, things like iPhones, PSP’s, and even iPods have had huge success at relatively higher price points. And remember, with the Sony PS3, you get an incredibly powerful gaming machine, plus a Blu-ray playback device at a pretty decent price point.
So, I don’t know exactly what the [magic] price point is, but I can say that acceleration tends to be geometric once you get below those incremental $50 lower price points. So when we look at how the market should progress, you should get a fairly strong ramp as we go from $400 to $249 to $199. Again, the question is when?
You also point out that there has been, in some ways, a proliferation of platforms but our point of view – and I think we’re right on this – is that gamers tend to be very situational. So someone doesn’t buy, say, a PSP or an iPod to play a game on those instead of a PS3 or a 360. PSP’s, DS’s, and iPhones are for portable gaming – much more quick hitting. Consoles like the 360 and PS3 are for much more in-depth gaming. The Wii has been for much more social gaming. That’s another initiative we have – taking advantage of people trying to play games more together.  
So there’s a proliferation of platforms but what you have to do as a marketer is say, “Where is my particular customer on that platform?” And if you target it that well, I think there’s a lot of opportunity. Particularly right now, when you see a lot of those platforms with different consumers on them.
Q: Brian, I’d like to test your confidence on Saints Row 2. In terms of variability, this is probably your biggest product of the year. What do you think as you get closer to launch?
A: Well, let me start by saying that we have a very broad product line and I never want to get anyone – whether it’s retail, investors, or internally – focused on one product.
That being said, Saints Row 2, in my view, is the biggest sandbox game ever built, with the most toys for gamers. It’s got tremendous, over-the-top combat, terrific weapons, a very unique online cooperative play mode that’s been getting a lot of accolades from the press. The character customization, I’ve never seen anything like it. We’ve seen people testing the game, playing for hours just with the customization mode. 
So, it is a great product. We think we have a great window for it. We are very pleased with retail’s feedback, but it’s not just about launch day. We think we’ll have a very strong launch, but it’s about driving that brand both here and in Europe and in Asia. So it’s a long-term brand. That’s what we’re looking for with Saints Row 2.
Q: Can you talk about the internal focus on product quality? What should we be focused on with the de Blob release to let us know that the product quality really has improved?
A: Yeah, let’s talk about that product quality initiative that we’ve set out on – I think we announced it last October. It had a couple of prongs to it. One is, we added some people in the corporate office. 
One, a Vice President of Creative Management. He was an outside hire, some of you may have met him at E3. Many years in the creative development organization at Electronic Arts. Very strong hire. His job is to make sure our production values – story, music, character development – are competing at the highest level. Also, things like graphic quality, in-game cinematics – we think Danny can add tremendous value.
The other guy was promoted internally. He used to run our Rainbow Studios — Roy Tessler. He is a production management professional. It’s all about schedule and budget with Roy. What that’s done is that it’s given myself and my team greater visibility on the tradeoffs between hitting a date and hitting a quality level so that we maximize quality on all of the key drive titles.
One of the reasons we’ve had this dearth of product flow recently is that we’ve moved a number of products out to hit that. What I was very pleased at, really three proof points – starting with a European tour about a month ago, we got great feedback from retail about the strength and quality of our product line.
I was extremely pleased coming out of E3, and now your question, specifically, about de Blob. It won one of the most anticipated games of the show overall. Another press outlet that runs Best of E3 called it the best Wii game of E3. But not just de Blob, a number of our titles won awards at E3, which I think is a proof-point that what we’re doing is working.
Now it’s not like we started last October and we’re finished today. Along the continuum, we’ve made a lot of movement but I won’t be satisfied until every product comes out at the highest level of quality, particularly on the core gamer metrics. 
So, yes, E3 was a huge proof-point for us. Now we want to make sure that quality resonates with consumers as well. We’re very pleased. de Blob is a very high-quality game, Saints Row is a very high-quality game. Even something like WWE, which is a licensed brand, we continue to invest in new things just to make sure that brand stays fresh.
If you stay with things like on Red Faction, I’d put that technology that we worked on for four years up against anything in the industry. Lot of shooters out there, nothing has the destruction technology of Red Faction: Guerilla.
So you’ve got to look at each product individually, which is how we do it. The proof-point is going to be “How does it resonate with consumers?” We think that the recent success that we’ve had with the press at E3 gives us a lot of confidence.
Q: On that point of the Wii, we’ve seen other third-party products that have been reasonably well-reviewed but based on new IP, not sell through very well on the Wii for a number of different reasons. What should our expectations be for de Blob? Is this a game that could sell a million or more units in the first couple quarters?
A: You bring up a good point. For the last couple years since the launch o
f the Wii, Nintendo has dominated the Wii with a huge slate of first-party products. We don’t see that many drive titles coming from Nintendo in our market opportunity, so we think we have a great market window coming out this September with de Blob.
What I love about de Blob, I said before. Not a tremendous investment because with the Wii, you can invest a fair amount and get a very high-quality product. So the upside leverage there — if we can create a hit – the upside leverage is very, very strong there. So that’s why we’re confident in de Blob, but also a key objective for us is to make sure we establish the brand.
We want to make sure that we have success so that we can bring it back to the Wii, and to other platforms. And you do that with high quality – drive the brand – and if we do that, there’s leverage and then there’s value creation.
Q: You guys have roughly $300 million in cash. What do you plan to do with it?
A: I’ve been saying the same thing for several years about cash. The highest and best use of cash is investment in intellectual property. That means investing in studios. Both growing ones we already own – we’ve had great success with studios like Volition and Relic, starting with a core team and building out super high quality studios. 
We’ve also bought studios. We bought one last year. We had identified role playing games as a huge market opportunity. We bought Big Huge Games and we like what we see there. There’s two products we haven’t announced yet under development there, but a very, very experienced and professional team.
We have an MMO in development in our Austin studio based on our very successful Warhammer 40K franchise. That’s a product — it’s way too early to start talking a lot about it – but if you look at what’s happening in the MMO market and why that product has a great chance of success; it has all the elements of why people like MMO’s. It’s a variability of characters and powers, yet it’s set in a very unique Science Fiction environment. That’s a very large investment.
So we’ve invested in brands and new licenses – it’s all about IP, so that’s the highest and best use of cash.
Q: Where are investors underappreciating THQ?
A: I think it’s in the power of our studios. We’ve been very forthright in saying, you know, “We didn’t execute well last year against our owned IP.” That’s why undertook the product quality initiatives that we’ve done but, frankly, we’ve done it before. 
I don’t mean to sound overly optimistic or defensive, but Relic Entertainment created the highest-rated real-time strategy game ever for the PC market. Volition has created – before we even bought them – did the Descent series for those of you old and crusty gamers in the PC market. 
The original Saints Row, the original Red Faction – we have a very strong studio system. Yes, we did not have a good flow from them last year but I think you’ll start seeing the benefits of that coming up with de Blob in September and continuing through the launch of UFC in the June quarter of next year.
So, I think it’s the underappreciation of the strong pipeline that we have for the next several quarters.

Some consolidation in the world of enterprise storage to kick off the new year: the storage and data security giant Imation Corp. has acquired Nexsan Corporation, a specialist in disk-based storage systems, for $120 million, with $105 million of that in cash and the remainder in publicly-traded Imation shares, according to a statement from the companies.
The move appears to be a part of Imation’s efforts to rebuild its business around more high-growth areas, as it comes off a particularly bad quarter of declining revenues in all of its existing lines of business.
Like many other startups in the enterprise space, Nexsan was a success story that somewhat flew under the radar. Nexsan competes against companies like EMC and HP selling storage specifically to companies in the small- and medium-business sector. It appears to have only raised $7.5 million in funding since being founded in 2000. In 2011, it had revenues of $82 million with margins of over 40% on its products.
For Imation, which offers storage solutions both to enterprises and consumers, the deal will add 11,000 customers to its books, and give it a boost in its business targeting the SMB segment — a sector that has followed in the footsteps of larger enterprises by increasingly needing remote storage alternatives for their data, a key area to target as business growth among larger enterprises slows down and faces more competition from larger players (like HP and EMC). As Mark Lucas, the president and CEO of Imation, puts it, Imation is “targeting markets with strong growth rates.”:
“Our strategy includes focusing on the underserved SMB market with purpose-built storage systems and appliances,” he noted in a statement. “This is a market that Nexsan knows well.”
Investing in healthily-growing areas is an imperative at the moment for Imation: the company in Q3, at the end of October, reported that its revenues were $248.2 million, down 19.6% from Q3 2011, on the back of missing revenue expectations in “almost all lines of business” and all regions, but with specific problems in the company’s traditional media storage business — which will have been disrupted massively by the big rise in lower-cost cloud-storage services.
Imation also posted an adjusted operating loss of $6.5 million: that included a benefit in restructuring and other charges of $3.6 million, and a diluted loss per share of $0.17. Excluding those charges the loss would have been $10.1 million.
One recent appearance of Nexsan in the news was in September, when it was named, along with Rackspace and others, in a patent lawsuit filed by PersonalWeb and Level 3 over Github hosting. We are reaching out to the company to find out the latest developments in that case. Update: Imation “will not have any liability with respect to the case you reference,” an Imation spokesperson writes in an email, but she would not comment further on whether the case has been settled or dismissed.
Nexsan, which is based in Thousand Oaks, California, employs about 200 people across the U.S., UK and Canada. These employees, led by CEO Philip Black, will all be joining Imation, the company says.
Imation Acquires Nexsan Corporation
Acquisition Further Strengthens Imation’s Tiered Storage and Security Solutions Growth Platform, Accelerates Strategic Transformation
OAKDALE, Minn.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Imation Corp. (NYSE: IMN), a global scalable storage and data security company, has reached an important milestone in its strategic transformation. Imation today announced that it has acquired privately held Nexsan® Corporation, a Thousand Oaks, Calif.-based provider of disk-based storage systems. As the Company continues to execute its strategy, Imation is leveraging its deep data storage core, building a platform for long-term growth and improving operating margins in high-growth data storage and security solutions markets.
“We are excited to have Nexsan become part of Imation”
The acquisition of Nexsan brings to Imation a proven technology platform and a robust portfolio of disk-based and hybrid disk-and-solid-state storage systems with more than 11,000 existing customers worldwide. It is expected to significantly accelerate Imation’s growth in the small and medium-sized business (SMB) and distributed enterprise (SME) storage markets. Imation will provide the Nexsan business with global scale and a well-known storage brand for global expansion. With SMBs and SMEs struggling to address their rapidly increasing data storage and management needs, the combined Imation and Nexsan portfolio will offer customers an attractive, price / performance alternative to competitive offerings.
The combination cash-and-stock transaction included approximately $105 million in cash and 3,319,324 Imation common shares, the equivalent of approximately $15 million.
“Imation’s acquisition of Nexsan is an exciting next step in our strategic transformation, which includes investing in growth platforms in data storage and security solutions, where we are targeting markets with strong growth rates,” said Mark Lucas, president and CEO of Imation. “Our strategy includes focusing on the underserved SMB market with purpose-built storage systems and appliances. This is a market that Nexsan knows well. Nexsan’s management team has grown this business from start-up to more than $80 million, with strong gross margins. Nexsan is a successful company that is addressing some of today’s fastest growing trends in storage, and we are pleased that its management team, including CEO Philip Black, will join Imation. The combination of Nexsan’s products, technologies, and talented teams with Imation’s global reach and infrastructure will be an excellent accelerator for our growth strategy in storage solutions,” concluded Lucas.
“We are excited to have Nexsan become part of Imation,” said Philip Black, CEO of Nexsan. “Imation provides us the scale and global footprint to expand our business, while still keeping intact our award winning partner program, our strong management team and employees, and our innovative products and roadmap. We look forward to working as part of Imation to deliver compelling solutions that meet the growing storage, archive and compliance requirements of businesses worldwide. This is good news for Nexsan channel partners, employees and customers.”
Nexsan’s 2011 revenues were $82 million and are continuing to grow, with gross margins in the 40 percent range. This acquisition is expected to be immediately accretive to Imation’s EBITDA.
Approximately 200 employees, based in the U.S., U.K. and Canada, have joined Imation with this acquisition. The Nexsan business will continue to operate within Imation from Nexsan’s current headquarters in Thousand Oaks, Calif., under existing management. Integration and global expansion activities between Imation’s Tiered Storage and Security Solutions business and Nexsan will be determined in first quarter 2013.

Netflix made a big splash today with their announcement of a $100 set top box, built by a California startup called Roku, that streams free movies (for Netflix subscribers) to the living room.
Good for them. Instead of wading into a losing battle over cheap downloads and rentals (see Vudu, BlockBuster, AppleTV, Google, etc., which charge for each movie), they jump right to free. They know what the consumer wants.
Of course, the service isn’t really free. Users have to buy the $100 box, and continue to keep a Netflix subscription active ($18/month). There are 10,000 movies available on on the box, which is significantly less than the 100,000 or so titles on Netflix’s DVD mailing service (and it’s old titles, not new releases). But it’s also an order of magnitude more titles than are currently available on demand via Comcast, my cable provider. And just like Comcast and the other cable guys adopted Tivo’s DVR functionality into their boxes before Tivo could do much damage, look for them to eventually copy Netflix, too, and offer a much wider variety of on demand content.
Netflix is taking a big financial hit with this service, which originally launched via PC viewing only and has since expanded. Last year they said they were putting $40 million/year towards licensing and overhead costs.
But really, what choice do they have? BlockBuster is gnawing away at one side of their business (physical DVDs), while online services (and don’t forget BitTorrent) come at them from the other end. And now the cable companies will be focused on them, too.
It’s a wonder Netflix continues to flourish in such a hyper competitive market. They now have over 8 million subscribers, 21% more than a year ago, and 32% gross margins on their core business. Those margins have decreased somewhat, what subscriber acquisition costs have also dropped from $47 to just $30 per new member. But as long as they continue to give consumers what they want, they’re at least in the game.
Look for more devices with Netflix built in, including one from LG, later this year.

Lew Cirne, founder and CEO of the seven-year-old software analytics company New Relic, has a lot for which to be thankful. Near the very top of his list? The fact that New Relic went publicÂ a year ago, after raising roughly $214 million from investors. (Its market cap is currentlyÂ $1.78 billion.)
We talked earlier today about whatâs keeping so many other companies from doing the same. Our chat has been edited for length.
TC: Youâre a big believer in going public. At the same time, you sold your first company, Wily Technology, for $375 millionÂ in 2006 to CA Technologies. 
LC: A big part of why Wily didnât have the characteristics to endure as a public company was that we were able to land big deals, but there was a high degree of variability to it.
TC: Thatâs not true at New Relic? 
LC: The founding idea of New Relic was about building something that could endure as a public company, that would do well in hot and coldÂ markets. We wanted to be geared toward making good decisions even under the obligation of reporting financials every 90 days. So I wanted a 100-percent subscription business. I was focused on high gross margins; ours are 80 percent. We also focused on establishing a broad customer base of both small and big customers, so no one customer would have disproportionate sway [over our financial health].
Most traditional enterprise companies, the way they do financials depends on huge deals that almost always close in last five days of quarter, and thereâs a lot of risk in them, so in order to succeed in a predictable way, they wind up prioritizing the big deal over product integrityÂ andÂ strategic direction.
TC: IsÂ New Relic profitable or has it ever been? 
LC: Weâre not yet profitable, but have a very good handle on our growth versus profitability. You can invest more for growth or dial back for profitability, and we feel like weâve always had good control over that dial.
TC: Presumably, your public shareholders understand that story. 
LC: The shareholders I talk with understand that weâre a growth company. For example, the average New Relic customer spends 38 percent more than the average customer spent a year ago because weâve invested in new products that theyâre buying more of.
Shareholders obviously ask how we think about growth versus profitability, but we donât see pushback [because] we think it makes more sense to invest in new growth than to slow down and be a more profitable, smaller company.
TC: How much of your time is spent with shareholders? An oft-cited excuse for remaining private is that theyâre a huge distraction. 
LC: Thatâs ironic to me. I think itâs much more distracting to be a unicorn today, especially for employees who may have expectations that arenât based in reality when you factor in liquidation preferences and ratchets and valuation resets. Iâm very thankful we donât have that issue.
As far as the time commitment involved, I overestimated how much [being a public company CEO] would change my day-to-day job. I had a meeting with investors this morning, but [our business] is a story I love to tell, and itâs always foundersâ and CEOsâ job to tell their story to a broad number of constituents, so Iâm doing a lot of the same work. Now, the audience is just a little different at times.
TC: Itâs been suggested to me that itâs harder for employees of public companies to cash out during selling windows because thereâs more transparency in newer organizations, so aÂ wider pool of people is exposed to material information. Do you buy that argument? 
LC: That hasnât been an issue at all. Weâre careful that people with inside information trade in very strict accordance with the law, but thatâs not affecting peopleâs ability to address their liquidity needs. I can understand why someone with a portfolio of unicorns would say that, though.
TC: What of the argument that you canât innovate as much as a public company? Have you been held back from doing anything you might have as a private company? 
LC: We havenât. You always have to be thoughtful about how you invest your capital, but maybe because Iâm a product-oriented founder, investors believe that weâll be effective in building new things, as weâve demonstrated the ability to do before.
TC: Before you went public, you raised $100 million from Blackrock and Passport Capital. Can you talk about the investment terms to which you agreed and whether, looking back now, youâd agree to them again? 
LC: Our mindset has been to never take anything but the most vanilla, straightforward, management-friendly terms with one, single, standard liquidation preference, meaning that investors would get their money back [but not multiple times their money back]. We turned down higher valuations that came with stronger terms because we never believed that made sense. Companies that have taken that risk, I donât know if theyâd do it differently now.Â Â IâmÂ just thankful weâre not in that unicorn bucket.

Rocket Internet, the incubator run by Berlin’s Samwer brothers, has picked up hundreds of millions of dollars ($837 million, in fact) in funding this year for its e-commerce startups, with much of that focused on emerging markets, but today comes news of another significant investment for a far-flung part of the developed world. The Iconic, a fashion portal serving Australia and New Zealand with clothing, shoes and accessories, is picking up $26 million (A$28 million) in funding. Adding that to the $46 million (A$50 million) already raised, the site becomes the largest-ever investment in an e-commerce site in the country.
The round was led by Verlinvest, a family-owned investment group from Belgium, along with existing Iconic shareholders and Rocket regulars Kinnevik and Summit Partners.
Adam Jacobs, co-founder and MD of The Iconic, says the investment will be used to build out the site: adding more local as well as international brands, adding more enhancements to the site around user interface and CRM and a long-awaited mobile upgrade. The site is also working to build out what Jacobs refers to as the Iconic’s “fashion community.” This includes the obvious such as social media outreach, but also some offline activities, such as its own printed magazine (retro!) and collaborations for live fashion shows.
Jacobs and Rocket are not releasing any numbers yet on the Iconic’s revenues, average basket size or other financial metrics. But Jacobs does confirm that the site, founded in 2011 and now with 4 million monthly users and 45,000 products from 500 brands, is not yet profitable. This is actually very normal in e-commerce terms, he says.
“Typically online retailers can take many years to turn a profit, with Amazon first turning a profit in their sixth year for example,” he notes. “In contrast, we are seeing strong growth in the Australian market and are targeting a much faster time frame — the customer response to the Iconic brand and experience has been far stronger we would have imagined. So we are now focused on sustainable growth and are tracking well to our long-term goals.”
Those long-term goals, he says, will take the Iconic away from the low-margin sales that people typically associate with online commerce sites that are built more for scale. For one, that’s not possible in a market with a finite amount of consumers in it and no longer term plans to expand outside of Australia and New Zealand.
“When we think about sustainable success in online fashion, we think an EBIT margin of 10% is achievable over the long term,” he says, adding that gross margins in fashion are “naturally larger than, say, Amazon’s margins on products such as electronics.”
For now, the Iconic has a pretty open playing field in front of it: despite Australia and New Zealand being otherwise on par with other developed countries in terms of Internet, PC and smartphone penetration, e-commerce is still relatively nascent.
“We have high Internet penetration and smartphone usage, and high margins on retail fashion, as well as disposable income. But what is underdeveloped in Australia is the e-commerce industry,” says Jacobs. He says that ASOS, the U.K. online retailer, is its biggest competitor.
“ASOS targets young female customers, whereas the Iconic caters to a broader audience across women’s and men’s fashion as well as sports. We stock a higher representation of Australian brands as we know our customers love local designers.” .
Also working in its favor is that while the company’s addressable market is smaller than that of the U.S., it’s a dedicated user group, in a market where there are still relatively few choices for online fashion.
“When we think about scale we know the Australian consumer loves fashion and spends more per capita than almost anywhere else in the world. So while the addressable Australia and New Zealand market is only 30 million people, customers are hungry for great fashion. Additionally fashion e-commerce is growing at approximately 20 percent year-on-year in Australia whilst traditional bricks and mortal retail is flatlining, making this market a very attractive one to be in.”
This also sets up the site perfectly for acquisition by a bigger player looking to crack into fashion in the Australian market — a route familiar for the Samwer brothers, who have sold startups to Groupon, eBay and others looking to acquire for international growth.
It’s the combination of that opportunity, and the Iconic’s success in meeting its targets so far that have attracted Verinvest and others to the company. ￼￼￼”The Iconic management team has done an exceptional job of growing the company during the past year and we are happy to be investing in this great success story,” said Frédéric de Mevius, founder and chairman of Verlinvest, in a statement. “We have been working towards this investment for some months now and are pleased to confirm our participation.”
Like other Rocket Internet colonizations, the Iconic is but one of the startups that the Samwers have established in Australia: these include 21 Diamonds for jewellery; Wimdu (think Airbnb); HelloFresh (think Blue Apron or Plated); and Zanui (online homewares and furniture, à la Fab) — although Jacobs says the Iconic is the biggest of them all right now. It’s here where the company begins to benefit from some economies of scale. The company, like other e-commerce operations, also hopes to stand out in terms of logistics. In its case it offers three-hour delivery in Sydney and free overnight delivery around the rest of Australia, as well as free 100-day returns. It also sublets warehouse space to some of the other Rocket companies for their services.

No surprise: HTC’s run of declining quarters is predicted to continue. But the dip now looks set to push into the red in Q3. The Android mobile maker has just issued guidance for Q3, warning investors it’s expecting a loss of between 0 percent and -8 percent in the coming quarter. Its Q3 revenue is expected to be in the range of NT$50 billion ($1.7 billion) to NT$60 billion ($2 billion).
Despite what has the potential to be an extremely bruising coming quarter, if the loss is at the larger end of that bracket, HTC said it is hoping to see “improvements” in Q4, pointing to its plans to launch a range of mid-tier products “in the coming months.” The Taiwanese mobile maker is banking on bulking out its mid-tier to improve its ability to compete with the extensive device portfolio of Android behemoth Samsung.
“Our overall gross margin has been impacted by the relatively higher cost structure, lack of economy of scale and certain provisions needed to facilitate the clearance of aging products in the channel. Actions have been taken and we expect to see improvement in Q4,” HTC said in its guidance. “We are also optimizing our organization, including the improvement of management efficiency and effectiveness.”
Senior management changes have been an ongoing story at HTC this year. It has also been working to refresh its marketing strategy in a bid to ensure its less numerous — but well-reviewed — devices aren’t drowned out by the noise of Samsung’s well-oiled marketing machine, as well as the sheer volume of devices coming out of Korea.
HTC said its current flagship, the HTC One, has performed “well” — quantifying this as “better than that of our hero products for the same period last year.” It’s not breaking out specific device sales, however.
The company is continuing to follow Samsung’s playbook of iterating successful flagships by lining up a smaller and more affordable HTC One Mini to try to expand the momentum around the HTC One.
“We aim to extend the momentum as we enter into the second half of 2013. The new HTC One has also helped the company establish strong brand awareness and received numerous accolades as the world’s best smartphone. With the help of HTC One, we have regained superphone market share across major markets including China,” it notes.
“My leadership team continues to focus on execution,” added CEO Peter Chou in a statement. “We are seeing expected results as we fill the channels and meet demand for the new HTC One. As we broaden our focus to include a new member of the HTC One family, the recently announced One mini, we are looking forward to delivering great products and results in 2H.”
HTC also confirmed its Q2 results, following earlier unaudited reporting of the quarter, posting quarterly revenue of NT$70.7 billion ($2.35 billion), with gross margin of 23.2 percent and operating margin of 1.5 percent. Net profit and EPS were NT$1.25 billion ($41.63 million) and NT$1.50, respectively.

This was supposed to be the year that all the big video ad networks would begin going public, and it looks like it’s starting to come true. Less than a week after Tremor Video listed on the NYSE, competitor YuMe filed its S-1, announcing its intent to raise $65 million in an initial public offering.
YuMe’s numbers look decent for a company looking to go public: The company had revenue of $116.7 million in 2012, which grew by 70 percent over the prior year. It also increased its gross margin from 38 percent to 46 percent in that time. And YuMe is already profitable, posting net income of $6.3 million, compared to a net loss of $11.1 million the year before.
YuMe’s IPO filing comes despite a rough first week on the public markets for newly listed Tremor Video. While Tremor opened trading with shares priced between $10 and $11, the video ad network has seen its stock decline to below $8 today.
But while Tremor stumbled out of the gate, YuMe actually might be better positioned to please investors, at least from a numbers perspective. Its revenue, gross margin, and net income were all greater than what Tremor showed in its initial filing. YuMe is also growing a heck of a lot faster, perhaps due to the proliferation of connected devices serving up video ads.
YuMe is betting on more streaming video replacing TV watching, and on more ad dollars shifting to online viewers as a result. The company has an SDK that allows manufacturers to deliver ads from its network into devices like Roku streaming boxes and Samsung connected TVs. That’s probably a pretty solid bet over the long term. The question is how quickly that shift will actually start to happen.
YuMe has raised more than $70 million since being founded in 2004. Investors include SV Angel, Accel Partners, e.ventures, Khosla Ventures, DAG Ventures, Menlo Partners, Intel Capital, Samsung Ventures, Translink Capital and WestSummit Capital.

This morning Egnyte announced that it has taken on $29.5 million in new capital. The Series D round of funding was participated in by Seagate, CenturyLink, Northgate Capital, and prior investors Kleiner Perkins, Google Ventures and Polaris Partners.
You probably haven’t heard of Egnyte, but you know the space they compete in, butting heads with Box, Dropbox and others. However, instead of providing a purely cloud play, Egnyte is a hybrid product, fusing both local storage and cloud storage. The company’s bet is that for many large firms, the idea of having their most sensitive data on a public cloud is simply a no-go.
I spoke with the company about its financial performance, and was told that its current revenue range is between $25 million and $40 million. Egnyte declined to be more specific, but did say that it expects to become cash flow break even by the fourth quarter of 2014. Egnyte has current gross margins of 60%, but wants to boost that by a fourth, reaching 75% in the future. Egnyte expects to have between $95 million and $105 million in GAAP revenue in 2015.
According to its release, Egnyte has seen its “revenue [double] year-over-year for the past two years [and] expects to more than double revenue ending 2013.” Egnyte has now raised more than $65 million. Don’t let that number surprise you – Box recently took down $100 million in a single round.
So, where do those numbers line up with its competition? Egnyte is smaller than Box and Dropbox. Here’s TechCrunch on Box’s revenue curve:
The company was said to generate $10 million in the fourth quarter of 2011, with around $25 million in revenue for that full calendar year. Revenue for 2012 was tipped to be on track to reach $75 million. It was later reported that Box instead was on track for $85 million in revenue for that year.
And on Dropbox, from the same post:
According to the Wall Street Journal, Dropbox had 2011 revenue of $46 million, $116 million in 2012, and will produce something over $200 million this year.
There is a simply massive amount of funding, and spend in the enterprise file storage market. Google and Microsoft and Amazon are also in the space with various product mixes.
The fact that we’re mostly meeting Egnyte for the first time is something that the company wants to change, citing both international expansion and marketing as designated locations where it intends to spend its new monies.
Provided that businesses are as conservative as Egnyte expects, it could find itself well positioned to grow more quickly than its market, and absorb dollar share. That said, its competition is more intense than in nearly any other market sector. It’ll need every new dollar that it raised.
The next question for the firm will be when it expands vertically, and begins to build editing tools on top of its storage technology. That’s the next front in this war.

Apple CEO Tim Cook made a very candid introduction remark during the earnings call. “We acknowledge that our growth rate has slowed,” Cook said. He then said that Apple has experienced “tremendous successes” over the past few years and that may be the reason why growth is slowing.
“Decline in stock price has been very frustrating to all of us,” he said. Apple’s stock dipped below $400 a share just a few days ago. “The key to Apple’s strength is creating innovative products, and that is always in Apple’s control,” he continued.
Some numbers in Apple’s earnings release stood out. In the outlook section, Apple said that it expects flat revenue for Q3 2013 and a decrease in gross margins to 36-37 percent. It would mean that Apple could experience a profit decrease — a downturn was unimaginable just a couple of years ago.
Apple’s estimates are generally very conservative but the company was spot on for gross margins this time around. Tim Cook hinted at “great new products” launching in the fall. Profit could certainly make a come back for Q4 2013.

Apple has been the subject of plenty of financial scrutiny (perhaps even more so than usual) recently, and now all that speculation has come to a head.
The Cupertino company has just released its fiscal Q2 2013 earnings — it reported $43.6 billion in revenue (up from $39.2 billion in the year-ago quarter) along with $9.5 billion in quarterly net profit, which works out to earnings of $10.09 per share.
That means that the rumblings were true — Apple posted EPS of $12.30 back in Q2 2012, which makes this the company’s first year-over-year quarterly earnings decline in nearly a decade. Naturally, the bigger question is whether or not this ignominious milestone will mean anything for Apple going forward and there’s no clear answer to that just yet. Financially speaking, it was bound to happen sooner or later, but Apple’s recently cultivated image as a computing juggernaut could take a very prominent hit. Apple has $145 billion in cash in its coffers, so we can all lay off the doomsday scenarios, but CEO Tim Cook admits that the company’s growth has slowed. Cook also noted during Apple’s customary earnings call that the company would kick off an effort to buy back Apple shares to raise the value of its stock.

These past few days have been surprisingly turbulent ones for Apple (the company’s share price tumbled below the $400 mark just last week to a new 16-month low), so it’s no surprise to see that analysts weren’t quite as bullish on Apple as they usually tend to be. According to Bloomberg Businessweek, the analyst consensus was for Apple to announce earnings of $10.02 per share on $42.4 billion in revenue, which the company managed to beat. On the other hand, Apple’s own (once notoriously conservative) guidance from its last earnings release forecasted revenues between $41 and $43 billion. And Apple’s guidance for next quarter? The company expects to pull in between $33.5 billion and $35.5 billion in revenue and gross margin between 36 percent and 37 percent.
“We are pleased to report record March quarter revenue thanks to continued strong performance of iPhone and iPad,” Apple CEO Tim Cook noted in the release. “Our teams are hard at work on some amazing new hardware, software and services, and we are very excited about the products in our pipeline.”
Despite the fact that Apple didn’t release or unveil any new hardware in Q2 (as some eagerly suggested it would), device sales were still nothing to sneeze at. As always, we’ve got more detailed breakdowns of how Apple did in terms of hardware this quarter courtesy of Jordan and Darrell, but here’s how the company did in a nutshell: Apple sold 37.4 million iPhones during Q2, along with 19.5 million iPads, but there’s no longer any word on iPods. Mac sales came up short as well, as Apple sold 4 million of them back in Q2 2012 compared to “under 4 million” this time around.
(You can find all of our other Apple charts here)
Not too shabby considering that iDevice sales are up across the board compared to the year-ago quarter (and in the iPad’s case, dramatically so likely thanks to the iPad mini), but the lack of any new standout products has weighed heavily on some people’s minds over the days and weeks that have led up to today’s release. Apple hasn’t pulled back the curtain on a new product since the iPad mini was unveiled back in October 2012. There’s nothing intrinsically wrong with that — the company likes to stick to its timetables after all — but the release of impressive new smartphones from Samsung and HTC could mean that Apple could be facing even stiffer competition as it works to dominate the mobile market. That could all change very shortly too, as rumblings of a new iPhone to be unveiled sometime this summer (along with a possibly cheaper model to follow) continue to circulate.
While Wall Street may have had concerns about Apple prior to the release, Apple’s stock price is up roughly 4 percent in after-hours trading.

Design-focused commerce company Fab has raised that round of funding we scooped a few months ago. Fab is announcing today that it has raised $150 million in the ﬁrst tranche of the company’s Series D round of ﬁnancing. We’re told that $150 million is the ﬁrst part of a larger Series D round that Fab expects to complete over the next few months. New to this round is Chinese Internet giant Tencent, who will also have a board seat at Fab; and Japanese conglomerate Itochu. Previous investors Atomico, Andreessen Horowitz, Menlo Ventures, RTP Capital, Pinnacle Ventures, Lars Hinrichs, and Docomo Capital also participated in this latest round of ﬁnancing.
This brings Fab’s total funding to $310 million. We’re hearing from multiple sources that the pre-money valuation of the company was $1 billion, as we had reported in April (a spokesperson for Fab has confirmed the valuation). And we’ve also heard from a source that Fab will be raising another $100 million or more in the later part of this round. At Fab’s last round of financing in 2012, the company was worth around $600 million. Past investors include First Round Capital, SoftTech VC, Baroda Ventures, Ashton Kutcher, Guy Oseary, Thrive Capital, Kevin Rose, SV Angel, The Washington Post, VTB Capital, Phenomen Ventures and the Times of India.
Founder and CEO Jason Goldberg said the company started down the fundraising route in March to raise enough capital to have several years of runway, at least until 2015. He added that for this round there was $400 million worth of interest coming from investors.
Growth, International And Another Pivot
Fourteen million users strong, Fab is continuing to grow at a fast clip after its initial pivot. Last year, the company saw $120 million in revenue, and revealed in February that sales were up by nearly 300 percent in January 2013 over January 2012. In fact, January was Fab’s third-highest sales month ever.
According to the company, Fab should reach $250 million in 2013 sales. Fab’s now achieving 43 percent gross margins, up from 29 percent in 2011. Interestingly, Fab says that most of its revenue is not derived from flash sales, which was the initial model Fab adopted after its pivot in 2011. As we wrote in this profile of the company, Fab infamously pivoted from Fabulis, which was a social network for the gay community, into a flash sales site. Fab says that two-thirds of sales are currently not from the flash-sales on the site, and the company recently rebranded to reflect this change. And 50 percent of Fab’s sales are in home categories.
In May, Fab debuted its new design store, which makes it more of an integrated e-commerce site. You can access design pages by room, type of furniture, color, designer and more.
International is also a huge potential growth area for the company. Fab has 1 million members in the UK, which is generating nearly 40 percent of its sales in Europe and is its fastest-growing market outside the U.S. Asia is the next frontier, which is why Goldberg and Fab are bringing on Tencent and Itochu as partners.
As Goldberg explains, there are currently only four e-commerce companies in the world that are valued at more than $10 billion: Amazon, Alibaba, eBay, and Rakuten. He believes that Fab has a legitimate chance to be the ﬁfth by leading in what he calls Emotional Commerce. This basically means that Fab helps people discover the items they love and want.
Part of Fab’s plan to take over emotional commerce involves making its own line of products and home goods. Fab is also partnering with designers to manufacture and sell home furnishings exclusively through Fab. Additionally, Fab is experimenting with brick and mortar stores, with the first store debuting in Hamburg, Germany. Mobile is also a huge growth area, with one-third of sales being placed via mobile. And international will also be a major strategic focus for Fab, which just acquired German custom furniture store Massivkonzept. Fab sells products in 27 countries and 40 percent of sales today occur outside the U.S.

What Fab Is Spending The Cash On
$150 million is a lot of cash, and Fab is raising more. Where is the money going? Goldberg says that Fab will be investing in additional enhancements to its supply chain, logistics, customer service, technology, and merchandising. At the beginning of 2012 it took 16 days — on average — from time of purchase to shipping a product. Today, 75 percent of Fab’s orders ship within 24 hours of purchase, and Fab wants to make sure this is the case for 100 percent of the products sold on the site. This year Fab will open its own new Fab-operated warehouse in The Netherlands to serve European customers. In 2014 Fab will open a warehouse in the Las Vegas area.
As mentioned above, Fab will also be doubling down on manufacturing and designing more products in-house, as well as working with designers to offer items exclusively on Fab. We can also expect more development in social and mobile. And Goldberg says Fab will be putting more investment in international (likely via more acquisitions, as it has bought five companies in two years).
With the Tencent investment, Goldberg says that Fab will be working together to expand the site’s presence in China.
As for why Fab has raised as much as it has in only two years, Goldberg maintains that this is how retail works. “Tell me an e-commerce business that is worth more than $5 billion that hasn’t raised a lot of money,” he says. To fund things like logistics, fulfillment, inventory and manufacturing, a business needs a lot of capital, he explains. He adds that if Fab stayed as a U.S. business, the company wouldn’t need to raise as much.
There is also now a somewhat clear path towards profitability, at least for the U.S. and European businesses. Goldberg says that Fab will likely become profitable in its U.S. and European operations by Q4 2014 or Q1 2015.

Freemium wireless data startup FreedomPop has been out to undercut traditional wireless carriers on data plan costs for over a year now, but now the company wants to up ante once more. In exchange for a recurring monthly fee of $0, users of the company’s forthcoming phone service will be able to get 500MB of wireless data access, 200 voice minutes, and unlimited messaging starting later this summer.
Oh, that’s not enough for you? For an additional $10, you get unlimited voice too. 
FreedomPop COO Steven Sesar says that everything the company has done so far — from attempting to wrangle a deal with LightSquared to fine-tuning the value-add features of its currently data-only service — has all been so the company could eventually offer this sort of freemium mobile service.
“This is always been what our M.O. was about,” Sesar told TechCrunch. Originally the team (which has swelled to around 60 people over the past few months) was waiting for Sprint to launch its LTE network more widely before taking the plunge, but ultimately decided that VOIP quality over 3G was enough to warrant bringing the service to market sooner. 
The company plans to release a handful of WiMAX-friendly Android smartphones when the service officially launches later this summer, and the lineup is surprisingly strong — Sesar said that the Samsung Galaxy S II and S III would be among the devices that would launch with the service, along with at least one more handset. The devices will retail for between $99 and $199, though at this point it’s unclear whether FreedomPop will sell the devices out right or hinge on a deposit method the company has mulled over in the past.
Thankfully, prospective customers can choose from a selection of devices that FreedomPop doesn’t strictly offer on it’s own. Sprint (FreedomPop’s more prominent network partner) pulled back the curtain on a bring-your-own-device program for MVNOs earlier this year, and FreedomPop confirmed to TechCrunch that their new phone customers will eventually be able to fire up existing Sprint devices on the company’s freemium phone service. 
At this point though, FreedomPop is still being very cagey about how exactly the experience is going to work for its users. Aside from pointing out that this is a “purely data play” and that voice calls would be routed over a data connection, Sesar wouldn’t divulge any more details — I get not wanting to spread the secret sauce, but a little extra transparency could only help FreedomPop lock up more credibility as it gears up to take on carriers in a bigger way. FreedomPop announced a partnership with textPlus earlier this year to bring messaging and voice calls to the service’s users, but both parties have been keeping mum on the subject until then — it’s possible that this endeavor has been built on the back of that tie-up, but we’ll have to wait and see for now.
As always, it’s the company’s hope that customers who have latched onto their free monthly plan will indulge themselves with additional services (like that $10 voice bucket mentioned earlier). These past months have been a trial run of sorts for FreedomPop to work out the strange economics of its freemium services, and things seem to be going well — Sesar notes that there are “hundreds of thousands” of FreedomPop accounts and that gross margin on its services are over 50 percent. That doesn’t mean that this gutsy move will ultimately pay off, but the company appears to be on relatively firm footing for now and the lure of free service may be too much for some consumers to handle.

Conventional wisdom has it that Apple has reached its peak and can only disappoint from now on. Yet, many financial facts don’t make sense. The market is too harsh with Apple compared to its competitors. But when it comes to products, there is an unsettling detail: there was no product release during fiscal Q2 2013. While Apple is certainly not doomed, its future looks gloomy. That’s why today’s earnings will be important for the company.
“I am a dreamer. I know so little of real life that I just can’t help re-living such moments as these in my dreams, for such moments are something I have very rarely experienced.” –Fyodor Dostoyevsky, White Nights (1848)
Apple’s growth has been incredible over the past two years, with double-digit growth for sales and profit. For years, Apple bloggers have vigorously criticized analysts’ expectations regarding Apple earnings and units sold. Basically, Wall Street analysts were setting the bar too high for units and market share, and too low for profit and sales.
It led to distortion. With a very minor market share, Apple was able to capture a big profit share. The company reported hit after hit after hit — that’s why Apple shares were doing so great even though sales were “disappointing” according to some analysts — the bottom line is more important than anything else.
But now, analysts have caught up and Apple is only able to pull out mixed earnings compared to estimates. Even iPhone sales are now below analysts’ expectations. The company was supposed to sell between 6 million and 10 million iPhone 5 during opening weekend. In reality, it sold 5 million units.
As a reminder, for the first weekend alone, analysts predicted sales of 1 million iPhone 4 and 2 million iPhone 4S, compared to 1.7 million and 4 million actual units sold.

This time around, analysts have to lower their expectations to get closer to reality. Fortune’s consensus puts Apple’s Q2 2013 revenue at $42.6 billion with estimated earnings per share of $10.21. Revenue would still be up 8.7 percent year over year.
But it’s disappointing given the incredible growth trend over the past couple of years. One of the reason is that gross margin will be lower than what it used to be. Last year, Apple reported a 47.4 percent gross margin. The company now expects a 37.5 to 38.5 gross margin.
Over the past six months, Apple was considered a flagging company based on multiple metrics. However that is far from the truth.
There are a few finance facts that just don’t make sense when it comes to Apple’s outlook — Apple shares dropped below $400, a 16-month low. It’s easy to see that disparity if you compare Apple to other public tech companies.
Apple’s P/E ratio is incredibly low. Comparing the stock’s performance with its earnings is a great way to see whether the stock market is asking for a fair price. At 9.042, Apple shares are clearly a steal. Companies with a greater P/E ratio are supposed to have better growth prospects. It includes Microsoft (15.8) and Google (23.82), even though those two companies are not as consistently profitable as Apple

Apple’s P/E ratio
When it comes to market capitalization, Apple has shrunk a lot. On September 19 2012, its market cap was $656.51 billion — it now is $374.37 billion. It represents a 43 percent decrease in seven months. While the company’s market cap was very high, its downturn is even more impressive. To put it into perspective, this market cap decrease is greater than the market capitalizations of Amazon, Facebook, Yahoo!, HP, BlackBerry and Nokia combined.

Apple’s market capitalization
The market cap graph is very similar to the P/E ratio graph because Apple’s earnings are still steadily growing year over year. Only the stock performance disappoints. On September 19, shares were trading at $702.10. Other companies, such as Google, have experienced troubled times as well but have gotten back on their feet — from $710 to $260 then back to $600 in less than two years. When it comes to analyzing the stock market, irrational behaviors are still very dominant and that’s why it is too early to rule out Apple shares. For example, Sterne Agee updated its price target yesterday from $630 to $610, sill way above today’s price.

Google’s stock performance in 2008—2009
As John Gruber points out, Apple is not friendly with investors. Even though it has started handing out dividends, the company still has more than $130 billion in cash. Investors consider that Apple should actually use this cash for investments, dividends and other financial activities. In the meantime, the company will continue to suffer on the stock market.
In addition to changes on the stock market, Apple products are at a turning point. Due to the incessant product releases during fiscal Q1 2013, no product was released or even announced during Q2 2013. It hasn’t been this long for years. In the past, shares have been boosted by the anticipation of a new product, such as the iPhone 5.

The iPad mini is out, now what? As adoption graphs will tell you, in order to succeed, a company needs to perpetually innovate, even if it means out-innovating and killing your own products. Apple has been very successful at this, killing the iPod mini, releasing an iPad that could compete with its computers, etc. Yet, it wasn’t the case recently. Volatility and uncertainty kicked in.
The next breakthrough innovation could be a watch or a TV, but those two products are not ready for prime time yet — if they even exist. It is unclear what Apple will release over the next six months, incremental iPhone and iPad updates aside.
“I can’t go back to yesterday because I was a different person then.” –Lewis Carroll, Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland (1865)
Apple used to be at the top of the world with the iPhone 3GS. It could simply put a faster processor and call it “3GS” to create a massive success. These days, Samsung is eating away at Apple’s market share and HTC is finally innovating again. Even though the iPhone 5 was a massive improvement over the iPhone 4S, naysayers still found it too similar to its predecessor. Since then, iPhone sales have been great and nobody can call it a commercial failure. But Apple needs to create ah-ha moments again, because it is a company that relies a lot on storytelling.
It all comes down to perception. Is Apple doing well? If you consider its earnings, it is still a growing company with massive successes, such as the iPhone 5 and the iPad product line. If you consider its long-term outlook, Apple’s growth prospects are now gloomy.
While we wait for breakthrough innovations, today’s earnings will be a great indication of the company’s performance without any new product release. It is a post-holiday quarter and a transition period. Apple could miss expectations for Q2 2013 while still growing, but many questions would remain unanswered regarding Apple’s future. Without any new product in sight, it’s hard to tell whether Q3 and Q4 2013 will be as successful as Q3 and Q4 2012.

Nokia has just reported is results for Q1 2013 with sales of $7.6 billion and a non-IFRS loss per share of $0.03 (and a reported EPS of $0.09) — a mixed result compared to analyst estimates, who had expected a loss per share of $0.05 on revenues of $8.65 billion (€6.6 billion).  That estimated loss per share is effectively half of what it was a year ago, when Nokia posted a loss of $0.08 per share. 
Nokia’s operating loss was $196 million, and while that’s down into the red again compared the previous quarter, when it posted an operating profit of $557 million, it’s a very significant improvement on a year ago, when its operating loss was $1.7 billion. Similarly, operating margin for the quarter was negative 1.5%, a reversal on the 6.8% of last quarter, but much better than the negative 5.1% of a year ago.
Analysts had also estimated that Nokia would report sales of 5.6 million Lumia devices for the quarter, and there Nokia was right on target, noting that the 5.6 million Lumias that it has sold are 27% on last quarter. The company has been building out the range of handsets it’s been selling in the last quarter, extending further into midrange and less expensive models. Nokia is estimating Lumia sales of 7.1 million for Q2, another rise of 27%.
“Nokia Lumia performance is promising considering this is the weakest quarter of the year and the new low end smartphones were not yet out,” noted Francisco Jeronimo, an analyst with IDC.
These are small but encouraging signs. To put these Lumia sales numbers in to context, a Reuters survey estimates that in the same quarter, Samsung has shipped 61.6 million smartphones, while Apple has shipped 36.9 million.
Here’s how Nokia’s results are breaking down for this quarter:
Devices. Not an overall great picture here. Device sales were $3.8 billion, down a full 25% compared to last quarter, and 32% compared to a year ago. Although Lumia sales trends are pointing in the right direction, they are still not big enough to offset Nokia’s other declines. The company’s feature phone business, which it terms simply “mobile phones”, were at 55.8 million units sold — down 30% on last quarter and 21% on a year ago. Within the smartphone segment, the last dregs of Symbian attrition also continue to give the company grief: Nokia sold 6.1 million smartphones in total, down 8% on last quarter, and 49% for the year.
Regions. Although mighty China, the world’s biggest smartphone market, used to be Nokia’s oyster, that time has long passed with the double juggernaut of Android and iOS taking away appetite for Nokia handsets. China saw the biggest drop of any region for Nokia in terms of sales by value and volume. The company reported $334 million in sales in Greater China, down 56% on a year ago, and putting it just above North America in terms of market size for the company. North America has been Nokia’s weakest market for some time already; China coming to join it in the bottom ranks is new. Of Nokia’s 61.9 million devices sold in the last quarter, only 3.4 million of those were in Greater China. Interestingly, North America was the only market in which Nokia saw a small increase in sales compared to last year — up by 9%, as some of its carrier deals to carry its smartphones continued to work their way through the balance sheet.
Here. CEO Stephen Elop announced in February that its mapping division would rebrand as “Here,” dropping the Nokia name, partly so that it could better target cross-platform business. Indeed, not only does it power Amazon’s location services, but Nokia’s maps are also available for Android and iOS, in addition to Windows Phone. 
Whatever Nokia wants to call its mapping division, the unit continues to be the smallest division in the company. It reported sales of $281 million, a decline of 22% both on last year and last quarter, with the margin on services currently at nearly negative 45%.
NSN. What a lot of the decline in devices has meant for Nokia is that its infrastruture business is suddenly looking relatively okay. Whereas Nokia Siemens Networks used to only yield sales that were half as valuable as Nokia’s devices segment, these days they are more level with each other: NSN sales were $3.7 billion, while devices were at net sales of $3.8 billion. More importantly, NSN is posting a profit: $4 million. Yes, it’s small but again relative to the rest of Nokia’s balance sheet, this stands out. It’s also the only division with a positive margin, of 0.1%.
Some of these results were forecast by Nokia itself. In its Q4 2012 results Nokia posted better-than-expected results, with 4.4 million sales of its new Windows Phone Lumia smartphones and sales of $10.7 billion, but it also warned of a weaker Q1.
At the time, Nokia said it expected operating margin to be negative 2%, plus or minus four percentage points, citing “competitive industry dynamics” that have negative impact on smart devices and mobile phones. In other words, ever more competition from Apple and Samsung, which continue to keep a stronghold on smartphone sales, even as Windows Phone models, led by Nokia, are seeing gains. Indeed, Nokia noted that although Lumia smartphones continue to “ramp up” this may not offset larger consumer demand or the wider economic environment. 
It also noted last quarter that it expected Location & Commerce non-IFRS operating margin in the first quarter 2013 to be negative “due to lower recognized revenue from internal sales, which carry higher gross margin, and to a lesser extent by a negative mix shift within external sales.” 
We’ll be listening in on the call in just a while and will either update with more detail here, or post separately if the news merits it.

After taking so long to transition to its next-gen OS platform, the company formerly known as RIM has an awful lot riding on its first BlackBerry 10 handset, the Z10. The handset launched at the end of January in the U.K. and early February in Canada (and is due to make its official U.S. debut this month). Not a great sign, then, that some U.K. phone retailers appear to be cutting the price of Z10 tariffs, a mere month after launch — suggesting demand isn’t as strong as hoped, and that the device isn’t as competitive against the high end of Android and iOS as BlackBerry needs it to be.
Both Carphone Warehouse and Vodafone have slashed tariffs, according to the Telegraph. It also appears that Phones 4u is offering cheaper deals now. BB10 is BlackBerry’s attempt to turn around its sliding smartphone fortunes by offering a device to compete with the likes of the iPhone and Samsung’s Galaxy SIII. BlackBerry’s global smartphone marketshare fell to just 3.5 per cent in Q4 2012, according to analyst Gartner, down from 8.8 per cent in Q4 2011, while Samsung and iOS took 52 per cent of all smartphone sales in Q4 2012.
Carphone Warehouse initially priced the BlackBerry Z10 from £36 per month on pay monthly contract, bundling the cost of the handset into that tariff. It is now offering the phone from as little as £29 per month, although that tariff includes a £29 up-front free for the handset. The Telegraph also says Vodafone has introduced a new web-only deal for the Z10, costing £33 per month (this tariff also requires an up-front fee of £129). Phones 4u is also offering the Z10 on a £29 per month contract (again with a £29 charge for the handset), having initially launched the phone on contracts starting at £36 per month. It is also offering even cheaper tariffs, of around £20 per month, but with a much higher up-front fee for the device.
The Telegraph quotes James Faucette, an analyst at Pacific Crest, who said the tariff cuts move the Z10 away from the highest margin segment of the smartphone business. “We believe that meaningful price cuts so soon after launch, while probably at the initial discretion of the carriers, is likely to relegate the Z10 to being a mid-tier device with very low gross margins,” he said.
BlackBerry has been making a lot of noise about Z10 sales but hasn’t backed up its hype with any hard numbers, saying only that demand had exceeded expectation and that the Z10 is selling in “large numbers“. We’ve reached out to BlackBerry, Carphone Warehouse and Phones 4u for comment on the tariff reductions and will update this story with any response.
Asked how sales were going in the Z10’s launch market, the U.K., at the Mobile World Congress trade show in Barcelona last week, BlackBerry’s U.K. & Ireland MD Rob Orr also shied away from sharing any numbers, saying he was unable to provide much detail ahead of BlackBerry’s quarterly results.
Early sales in the U.K. have been “very positive”, he told TechCrunch, adding: “I’m in a quiet period so I’ll caveat my statement with the fact that our fiscal year ends on [March 1st] and we publish results on the 28th. Regulated from a quiet period perspective I can’t share too much detail but I’m very pleased with the results, the partners are very pleased with the results. Take a look at some of the feedback on Phones 4u’s site or Vodafone’s site are very positive.
“The feedback from our enterprise customers has been brilliant. Really really good. They love what we’ve done with BES 10, they’re aligned with the approach that we’re taking, they’re cracking on with all their internal trials and their user testing and all the stuff that enterprises do before they do mass rollouts. So I’m really pleased. Couldn’t really have asked more from the support I’ve had in the market.”
Expect to get more concrete details on exactly how positive (or not) the BB10 launch has been when the company announces its fiscal Q4 and fiscal full year results at the end of this month.
While the introduction of cheaper monthly tariffs may not help BlackBerry’s bottom line in the long run, it may help to drive a few more Z10 sales in the short term to help buoy up its results. In the mean time, all the vague, non-quantifiable statements aren’t helping dispel the sense that RIM isn’t yet doing enough to dig itself out of the smartphone doldrums.

Editor’s Note: This is a guest post by Mark Suster (@msuster), a 2x entrepreneur, now VC at GRP Partners. Read more about Suster at his Startup Blog, BothSidesoftheTable.
The era of VCs investing in successful consumer Internet startups such as eBay led to a belief system that seemed to permeate many enterprise software startups that hiring sales or implementation people was a bad thing.
“We want low-touch or zero-touch businesses” was the mantra.
I believe it’s flawed.
While I have some sympathy with not investing too heavily in sales people until the product has properly been tested and commercialized in the enterprise environment, in the end it’s a fact that it takes sales people to move product through large organizations. And of course the most successful technology companies: Google, Facebook, Salesforce.com [duh], Oracle, Microsoft all have loads of sales people.
But the “no sales people” mantra isn’t what I’m here to take on. It’s the second belief system that is even more engrained and even more wrong. Many young startups are being advised not to have a professional services business and in my opinion, this is a big mistake.
The line of reasoning goes, “Services businesses are not scalable and the market won’t reward this revenue so make sure that third-parties do your implementation or clients do it themselves. We only want software revenue.”
This is a huge mistake. If you’re an early-stage enterprise startup services revenue is exactly what you need.
Let me explain why:
1. Successful Implementations
The most important way to sell a product for an early-stage business (or frankly any stage) is to have strong referenceable customers. These are the lifeblood of your sales organization. Referenceable means they are willing to be part of your sales collateral, willing to take calls from key leads, willing to speak at your conferences, etc.
How do you get referenceable customers? You build a great product and make sure it is used in such a way as to deliver real benefit to your customers versus just the promise of a benefit outlined in your marketing materials.
As much as many non-experienced investors might like to believe, even great products don’t just roll themselves out. You need to implement them. This often means getting the product to talk with other existing products, implementing the product to match the specific needs of a customer’s internal processes, training, monitoring usage and encouraging adoption.
It also means creating communication plans to make sure that there is a senior sponsor in the organization who knows what the benefits are, as well as measuring and communicating the gains.
This is vital because every rollout needs a champion (the person in charge of rollout) and a sponsor (the senior person who has the budget and who stops the blockers from killing the project). And that’s just it – every project has blockers. The people who either want to do nothing or who prefer a different solution.
Your project is forked without a rollout organization, communications, measurement, integration and without turning sales into referenceable customers.
Trust me – this will NOT happen without a dedication implementation team.
Professional services = higher rate of successful rollouts.
2. System Integrations
As outlined above, one of the most important things to get an implementation right is integration. Your system as a silo will not deliver the same impact as your system talking with your customers other systems. And you can’t use the API argument to get out of helping with integration. As in, “Well, as a tech firm we put tons of effort into APIs so that you can do your own integrations. We prefer to sell software, not get involved with client systems.”
This line of thinking is expressed to me all the time by startup companies that think it is a pain to have to actually work with enterprise accounts. They prefer to just “innovate” and not have the grubby work of actually making their innovation work with real customers.
Good luck with that.
Your customers will not dedicate the teams to build the integrations because they are not yet committed enough to your product or company. This will happen organically in the future but not until you’re already large and successful.
And the other thing: The more your product is integrated with other systems, the lower your churn rate will be. Imagine when your competitor comes in with their new whiz-bang features. Your customer sees it and thinks, “I wish your product did that” and you respond that you will have that feature launched in three months. But knowing that your competitor can’t get the integration done by then and your customer doesn’t want to go through the hassle of doing another integration – guess what – you will have a safe haven at that account.
Professional services + systems integration = lower churn.
3. Channel Partners Not Yet Formed
I’ve heard many investors / advisors tell startups to have third-parties do the implementations rather than doing it themselves. “You’re a software company not a services company! We like software. Software gooood. Services baaaad. Just have third-party VARs & SI’s do the implementations.”
Politely listen but ignore them.
Why would you have your most important success factor (successful implementations) outsourced to a third-party where you don’t control quality and who is strictly mercenary (i.e. doesn’t care as much about the successful outcomes as I do). I highly recommend this strategy for any company who doesn’t care about referenceable customers.
Here’s the thing: until your sales volume is sufficiently large, no self-respecting SI or VAR is going to commit resources to making you successful. By definition you will either get a crappy SI promising you they will move mountains or a great SI that gives you their C-player team. Think about it – why should a great SI with tons of work commit to you while you’re still a small company?
I wrote about that extensively in “the fallacy of channel partners.” When you’re bigger, channels play a very important role. But while you’re early? You need to control the sale and the implementation.
I call the argument many investors try to make on this point the “Salesforce.com argument” and it’s bogus.
People often cite Salesforce.com, “They don’t do their own implementations! They have a third-party ecosystem. And they’re the best enterprise company out there so they must know something.”
I worked at Salesforce.com. I can tell you this argument is wrong. Salesforce did have their own professional services / implementation team. Salesforce’s success as a company early on was because their earliest customers DID have success and Salesforce put a lot of energy into making that happen.
Only after Salesforce.com went public did they consider cutting back on professional services because Wall Street didn’t reward the lower-margin business as much as the software business. But Salesforce knew how important this process is to their success so they actively encouraged the development of an ecosystem so much so that they even invested in these third-parties to make sure they were well-enough financed to survive.
Don’t fall for the Salesforce.com argument from your investors. It’s false logic.
Professional services = higher quality implementation.
4. Your Best Eyes & Ears
What did I learn from nearly a decade of doing system integration projects at Accenture early in my career? Your most successful sales people are the people who are on the ground doing the implementations.
But they’re technology people not sales people!
Precisely.
They know your customers’ systems. They are trusted by your customers exactly because they are tech people handling the rollout and making magic happen. They know your product intimately. And they form meaningful, trusted relationships with your customers.
So when your relationship-sales rep wants to figure out how to get a broader rollout of your product (more seats!) or how to sell new modules to those customers or how to get the CEO to be a referenceable customer for you, look no further than your implementation team to help this rep get the orders they need.
They are the gateway to your growth.
Professional services = upsell + cross sale + new business units
5. It’s Profitable Revenue Covering Your Fixed Costs
And finally, the most obvious argument is an economic one.
It’s true that professional services have a lower margin (say 45-55% gross margin) than software (typically 85-95% gross margin) and professional services business are inherently less scalable.
So I’m not endorsing your building your entire company around professional services (although I think that’s a fine strategy for many non VC-backed companies) but rather not to avoid it.
Let’s say you can do $1 million in software sales in your first year of selling delivering $850,000 of gross margin. Let’s say you can supplement that with $1 million in professional services revenue at $500,000 gross margin.
Need I point out that the $500,000 is still profitable revenue that can contribute to your central costs of running your business?
That it is non-dilutive financing?
That it is the driver of your future software revenue for next year?
Professional services = profitable revenue streams that fuel your business continuity.
The key is to not become overly reliant on professional services. There are some clear do’s and don’ts for how to layer professional services into a software business.
And I’ll address those in my next post.
Until then, happy implementations.

Editor’s Note: This is a guest post by Mark Suster (@msuster), a 2x entrepreneur, now VC at GRP Partners. Read more about Suster at his Startup Blog, BothSidesoftheTable.
I recently wrote a blog post in which I pointed out that many investors and advisors discourage enterprise startups from having a professional services (PS) business and I think this is a big mistake.
I think it’s important for enterprise startups to layer in professional services to their revenue streams.
PS capabilities are important for enterprise startups because they:
It’s all in this article if you want the details.
BUT!
You don’t want to run the risk of having a PS business that takes your eye of the ball of growing a large software business. So when I meet with GRP portfolio companies that do enterprise sales I try to emphasize the following:
1. Only Work on Projects That Support Your Core Product Effort
The most important thing to be careful about is to be sure WHY you’re doing the PS business. Hopefully it’s not to avoid fundraising or finding quick pockets of money.
Don’t become addicted to the quick hit of cash that a big implementation project can provide.
Your goal should be to do PS as a way of accelerating future non-linear software growth.
Therefore you need to be careful not to accept projects that are too far out of the core business. Each project should be related to rolling out your solution or you shouldn’t do it. Each project scope should be as close as possible to being restricted to:
That is the software business.
In the adtech world PS revenue often means providing “media services” as a value-add to using your product. This might mean helping customers buy traffic, arb’ing deals, helping with RTB pricing or trading, etc.
2. Minimize Any Custom Work That Will Not Feed Back Into Your R&D
While I’d like to say that you should never do custom work that changes the scope of your product, that’s not wholly realistic.  But you do need to be sure your company doesn’t just become the internal R&D department for a large corporation.
If you never read my post on Elephant, Deer and Rabbits – a guide to customer segmentation – it might be worth a read.
With a well-architected product that has well-documented APIs and proper core product abstractions, all custom work should be built above the API stack. Often your sales engineers can do the customizations without bugging the core eng team.
Extending the feature set of the product would obviously be better if done by the customer, but sometimes customers lack the resources to do customizations, so simply telling them to get stuffed is not the answer.
3. Protect Your Intellectual Property
If you’re doing custom work, restrict it to a small portion of the PS project and try to build stuff that can eventually find its way back into your core product roadmap to improve your core offering for future clients.
In fact, if you do the PS project well and narrow the scope to features that you know you’ll eventually need to build anyways, then it can actually be a great source of future innovation.
Importantly, make sure that you retain IP rights to your custom work, which needs to be part of the engagement contract. At a minimum co-ownership of the IP.
If it’s not specified in the contract, you might find yourself with future litigation over IP.
4. Integrate PS Work Into Sales And Marketing Processes
The reason to do the PS work in the first place is to drive future software sales. So make sure that your PS organization doesn’t become an island or a P&L unit that tries to maximize its own value by showing the most profitability and growth on that business unit possible.
The PS team is there to successfully engage. You want to make sure that they are communicating well and often with sales to drive future product sales at the customer level.
You want to be sure that you get customer commitments before doing the work. Do a case study afterwards if the project is successful. You won’t get every customer to agree to this but you certainly want to try with every customer. Referenceability is the lifeblood of sales. If asked to drop the price we would often counter by agreeing to small price decreases in exchange for an agreement to do case studies to drive future business. Frankly, you’re going to need to drop prices a bit anyways. After all, every customer wants their pound of flesh.
If you have a sales rep pushing a product implementation you want them to understand why selling PS will help them grow future revenue at that account and not as a crutch to hit short-term revenue targets.
Basically, no islands at startups. Everything needs to be part of a holistic company strategy.
5. PS Business Cannot Become A Management Distraction
Another rule I outline with our portfolio companies that sell enterprise solutions is that I don’t want them to become a distraction for management.
If your CEO is having to get involved too much in reviewing a project’s success, or your core product team is getting sucked into implementing too many features to support the rollout efforts, chances are you’ve gone too far.
The closest analogy I have for a PS person is a “sales engineer” who is normally a technical staff member who assists in sales campaigns. Often they have the same skills and can therefore be doubled up as PS if you are in a pinch to afford staff.
If PS involves too much management or core tech time, then chances are it will overtake your software strategy and you’ve then just become a prostitute for short-term revenue.
6. Control Size Of PS Revenue Relative To Software Business
So how much PS is too much?
There’s no right answer. It’s mostly a function of the stage of your business.
If you’re in your first year of developing your product, chances are you haven’t yet found product / market fit and you don’t yet have enough value to sell your product for as much as you’d like.
And chances are you’re in big need of a killer customer reference.
So it wouldn’t bother me if 90 percent of your year-one revenue was PS, provided it was done with a specific plan for year-two software sales. It also is a great way to finance your business without facing dilution before you actually raise venture capital and when the valuation you might get from angels is less than you’d want.
By year two I’d like to see PS at 50 percent maximum, which is still high.
By the time you’re at $5 million to $20 million in software sales, I’d like to see PS be no more than 25 percent of your total revenues.
I know that number sounds high for some people, but in reality if you’re growing fast it’s not unthinkable that you’d bill out $2.5 million in PS revenue on top of $7.5 million of recurring revenue (MRR) software sales.
As you hit steady state I’d like to see PS at about 15 percent of your business.
Rough guidelines. Lots of room for debate. But a good rule of thumb for planning.
7. Don’t Pay Full Bonus To Sales Staff On PS Revenue
Finally, be careful that you don’t incentivize your sales staff to make you into a professional services firm. You can’t pay full bonus on PS revenue. Not only because it’s lower gross margin, less scalable and more consumptive of staff, but also because, if you make it easy for them to sell PS — which is always higher revenue than paying for software — you’ll be sure they sell it ALL DAY LONG.
But it can’t be zero bonus.
If you have zero bonus on PS revenue you’ll find a sales team that becomes the PS prevention unit, and if you’ve bought in that this line-of-business is important to you, then you don’t want your best sales teams working against you.
There’s not one answer for how to comp the sales teams. It can be margin based or lower spiff for PS revenue than software revenue. Whatever. And obviously you need to persuade them that today’s PS business is tomorrow’s big commission check.
Happy to take any suggestion in the comments section as to how to properly incentivize sales teams.
Next post?

The first ad tech IPO of 2013 hit the NYSE today: Marin Software priced its 7.5 million shares at $14 each, raising $105 million at a valuation of $425 million. Trading under the symbol MRIN, the stock saw a small pop in its opening hour, rising by some 40% before going down again and currently trading under $18, a rise of some 20%-28% on the IPO price.
Marin had originally priced the IPO at $11-$13 for 7 million shares but expanded the offering ahead of today to reflect stronger demand.
Marin’s core product is a platform that advertisers can use to run campaigns across different online properties, including the biggies Google, Bing and Facebook, and different platforms, including mobile, online search, online display and social, with its reputation for search marketing particularly strong. Part of its offering is a big data play, in which it uses the mass of advertising traffic that it tracks to figure out for its clients which formats, and which placements, are giving them their best return on investment for future campaigns.
The company’s revenues have tripled in the last three years, a reflection of the bigger shift to online advertising from more traditional forms of media. Marin, in its S-1, cites projections from Magna Global that expect global spend will be $619 billion in 2017, up from $480 billion in 2012. Within that, digital ad spend will be $174 billion in 2017, up from $98 billion in 2012.
Marin is on that wave, with customers including ModCloth, PriceGrabber and Symantec, according to its SEC filing. But Marin but also has a road ahead of it to turn that into a profitable ride.
According to Marin’s S-1 that it filed in February when first announcing the IPO, the company in the first nine months of fiscal year 2012 made $42.5 million in revenues. That is nearly double the $24.7 million it made in the nine months a year before, but still has not been enough to push the company out of loss-making territory: it also reported a net loss of just over $19.2 million for the period, compared to $13 million a year before.
Prior to the IPO, Marin had raised $79.5 million in a series of six venture rounds, with backers including Benchmark, DAG, Focus Ventures and Triangle Peak.
Marin says in its S-1 that it might use use some of the proceeds for acquisitions. “We may choose to expand our current business through acquisitions of, or investments in, complementary businesses or technologies, using cash or shares of our common stock. However, we have no commitments with respect to any such acquisitions or investments at this time,” the company writes. For the moment Marin writes that the main purpose will be to raise capital, raise awareness and generally improve its competitive position.
Some predict that other ad-tech startups likely to go public this year include Criteo and Rubicon. Rubicon has been rumored as a Yahoo acquisition target (although that now seems to be off the cards), while Criteo currently works with Yahoo in Japan on performance-based inventory and is planning a move into China.
Update: We spoke to Marin CEO Chris Lien after the market closed, and he said the goal of the IPO was to “raise our profile and raise the profile of our category.” He added that as a public company, it will be “more of the same” — Marin has been steadily improving its gross margins by 10 percent annually, and he has “an aggressive plan for growth,” with hopes of bringing the company to the break-even point in 2015.
Marin closed off its opening day at $16.26, 16% above its IPO price.

Freelancer.com announced today that it has filed for its initial public offering on the Australian Securities Exchange. The company aims to raise $15 million AUD (about $14.2 million USD). Thirty million new shares will be offered to the public at $0.50 AUD per share. Its IPO values the online services marketplace at $218 million AUD (about $206 million USD). 
Freelancer.com plans to use funds raised in its IPO to fund organic growth and acquisition opportunities. The company disclosed in its  prospectus that it forecasts 2013 revenue at $18.3 million AUD (about $17.3 million USD), compared to $10.6 million AUD (about $10 million USD) in 2012, with gross margins of 88%. Consolidated net profit after tax is forecast at $471,000 million AUD, a 35% decrease from $728,000 AUD in 2012. Gross payment volume in 2013 is expected to reach $80.9 million AUSD. 
5.1 million new shares will be made available to eligible employees under Freelancer.com’s new employee share plan. Freelancers active on the site can invest through the Freelancer Foundation Shareholder program. 
Freelancer.com is currently the world’s largest online marketplace for outsourcing and freelancing services, as measured by the total number of users and projects. The site has over 9 million users and 4.9 million projects that it says is worth over $1.2 billion AUD.
Shortly after founding in 2009, Freelancer.com acquired GetAFreelancer. Since then, it has pursued an aggressive acquisition strategy to increase its global footprint, scooping up Scriptlance in Canada, EUFreelance, LimeExchange in the U.S. and RentaCoder/vWorker. Freelancer.com has itself been an acquisition target. Last month, Japan-based HR site Recruit Co., which is also preparing for an IPO, reportedly made a $400 million offer. Like Freelancer.com, Recruit Co.’s has been busy buying up competing sites, including NuGrid in India and Indeed.com. 
In Freelancer.com’s IPO prospectus, CEO and Chairman Matt Barrie said that Freelancer.com’s growth strategy focuses on the next wave of people to go online in developing economies. 
“Today, I find it hard to believe that with 7.1 billion people in the world, only 2.7 billion people are on the Internet. Almost 4.5 billion people are yet to connect. We are confident that there is tremendous growth potential ahead for the Company, as the rest of the world’s population goes online,” he wrote.

Apple has just released its fiscal Q4 2013 earnings, reporting $37.5B in revenue, $7.5B in net profit representing $8.26 per share. That marks a year-over-year growth of 4.2 percent in revenue and 4.7 percent decline in EPS, with net profit down 8.6 percent year over year.
Apple sold 33.8 million iPhones, 14.1 million iPads and 4.6 million Macs in the quarter, which allowed it to post record Q4 revenue. Analysts had estimated 33.4 million iPhones, 14.3 million iPads and 4.3 million Macs in the quarter. iPhone sales grew 26 percent to hit another record number. iPad sales were relatively flat. Apple sold a total of 71 million iPads in fiscal 2013. Apple sold just 3.5 million iPods in the quarter.
“We’re pleased to report a strong finish to an amazing year with record fourth-quarter revenue, including sales of almost 34 million iPhones,” said Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO, in a statement.
For comparison, Apple brought in $35.3 billion in revenue last quarter, with $6.9 billion in profits at $7.47 EPS. Apple is currently down 2 percent in after-hours trading.
Apple beat analyst expectations across the board for revenue, posting record Q4 numbers.
According to Fortune’s collated estimates, street analysts had projected $37.14 billion in revenue with EPS of $8.16. Estimates put year-over-year revenue growth at 3 percent and earnings growth at -6 percent. WSJ estimates had placed EPS at $7.94, which would give Apple a win in both categories as well.
Apple’s own guidance projected revenue at between $34 billion and $37 billion, with a gross margin of between 36 percent and 37 percent. Apple’s estimates have become increasingly accurate over the past few quarters, ever since it changed the way that it gave guidance. Previously, it had a reputation for severely under-estimating future quarters and it’s taken a bit of time for analysts to adjust to its new, more conservative outlook.
Apple finished the quarter with $146.76 billion cash on hand. Its projections for revenue in Q1 2014 are between $55 billion and $58 billion with gross margin of between 36.5 percent and 37.5 percent.
Apple’s gross profits fell to 37 percent, the seventh quarter in a row for such a decline. Much of that can be attributed to lower margins on devices like newer Retina iPads and lower-priced iPhones. If it hits the higher end of its Q1 ’14 estimates, it could reverse that for the first time in a while, but the lower end would mark another decline.
iPod sales were down 35 percent year over year, Macs were down 7 percent over the same period and iPads were relatively flat. iTunes and software revenues were up 22 percent and accessories were up 5 percent.
Even with only a couple of weeks of iPhone sales on the charts, it still accounted for 52 percent of Apple’s overall sales. The impact of the two new models, iPhone 5c and iPhone 5s, likely won’t be felt in full until Q1 2014.
The same can be said for the iPad, whose numbers are depressed due to no new model being launched in the period. We’ll see impact from the iPad Air, Retina iPad mini and reduced cost iPad mini in Q1 2014.
The average selling price of iPad was $439 up from $436 in Q2 and iPhone ASP was $577 in Q4.
			
Apple specifically noted that revenue in Greater China was up 23.5 percent sequentially, and 5.6 percent year over year.
			
Article updated to note Apple beat both Fortune and WSJ estimates.

Today during its earnings call, Apple CFO Peter Oppenheimer confirmed that future versions of OS X would be free. Last week, Apple announced that OS X Mavericks would be available for free, but did not confirm plans for future versions of its operating system.
Oppenheimer’s statements during the call indicate that future versions of OS X will also be free. This, along with iWork updates and free copies for each purchaser of Mac and iOS hardware, would contribute to a $900 million sequential increase in net revenue deferred for software upgrade rights and non-software services in the December quarter.
Basically, a larger slice of revenue from each device will go towards ‘paying’ for those free software upgrades under a law that doesn’t allow Apple to count revenue for freebies until the products they’re housed on are delivered. Apple noted that this would be enough to affect its gross margins, using the phrase “dollar for dollar.” This indicates that its margins might have been hit by as much as 170 basis points, increasing what it has estimated for its future margins.
The market responded to the news that Apple’s margin estimates were directly affected by the deferrals, popping by a few points.

Basically, this is the market reacting to the fact that Apple’s guidance for next quarter included these deferrals. That means that what looks like a flat growth curve is actually going to be a pop in disguise in Q1 ’14.
Oppenheimer says that these new deferrals would add to those already sliced off for software updates. He notes that this is now $15-25 per iPhone and iPad beginning in September, and on Mac it increased from $20 to $40 in October.
He says that it will record those deferrals over two years for iOS devices and over Mac for four years, slipping that revenue back in to the bottom line over years rather than ‘right now’ if it were to charge. Oppenheimer says that it will “work hard” to get down the cost curves on those devices in order to compensate for those increases.
Apple CEO Tim Cook said that the primary reason for Apple to make OS X and iWork free was to “make it a part of what it meant to own a Mac and what it meant to own an iOS device…Some other folks charge $199 for each of these — the OS and the productivity apps. We wanted to make it a part of the experience.”
Apple reported a strong quarter with $37.5B in revenue, $7.5B in net profit representing $8.26 per share. Apple sold 33.8M iPhones, 14.1M iPads and 4.6M Macs in the quarter.

Apple announced this week that it will make its iWork suite of productivity applications free on new OS X and iOS devices. The company also made the Mavericks update to OS X free for all users.
Microsoft recently released its Windows 8.1 update to Windows 8 for free, has begun to bundle its Office set of products with Windows RT, and now sells Office as a service through its Office 365 product.
The overlap between the two companies’ strategies and current product lineups both impact their short-term revenues, and long-term software and hardware margins. There is an increasing tension between the two companies’ largest computing platforms: Windows, iOS, and OS X. Given the spate of recent updates to those platforms, the transformation of Office, and Apple’s tossed productivity gauntlet, the software space that two firms are fighting to control is worth looking into.
We’ll deal with operating systems first then productivity software, and we’ll approach the topics as numbered lists to allow for brevity of a sort and clarity.
1. Apple will no longer charge consumers directly for OS X. Consumers will still pay for the operating system when they purchase an Apple computer, as the cost of developing OS X and its updates is implicit to the sticker price of the machines.
2. Microsoft generates most of its Windows revenue from selling licenses of Windows to its OEM partners. Consumers, therefore, rarely pay directly for Windows. However, the link between the cost of Windows and the consumer is far more direct than Apple’s consumers and OS X. There is an explicit cost to a copy of Windows – rumored to be around $80 – that is passed directly onto the consumer from the OEM at the moment of sale. Still, for most consumers of both platforms, the cost of the operating system is blurred to the point of complete obscurity.

3. Both companies moved to free updates to their operating systems at the same time, and that’s hardly coincidental. Imagine if Apple and Microsoft tried to charge for their updates. The result would be depressingly familiar fragmentation. This is a larger problem than in the past for both firms, as their desktop operating systems are increasingly fusions of software and services. Let the software fall sufficiently behind, and the services begin to choke. That won’t do. So, free updates.
4. The Mavericks update and Windows 8.1 are not directly comparable. Mavericks will upgrade a number of OS X variants, while Windows 8.1 won’t update more than a single Windows SKU (for this, we’re holding the RT version of Windows 8 close to its brethren).
5. Still, saying that Apple is now providing free of charge something that Microsoft is selling is at best partially correct. Keep in mind the dollar flow that exists between the teams that are creating the operating systems for each firm, and the — internal or external — hardware team in question.
6. This makes things all the more muddled, as there are both internal and external OEM groups that build Windows-based products. Microsoft has to move revenue from one bucket to another, but that’s more accounting than cost. So, there are external OEMs that pay Microsoft a fee for Windows, and a Microsoft group that has to shuttle money to that division. The point here is that consumers don’t see any of this. They simply see the sticker cost and then make a choice on the computer they want.

7. That leads to the following point: Apple has amazing margins on its hardware. The company’s gross margins are unheard of at other OEMs. Windows-based OEMs have abysmal margins. If Windows-based OEMs didn’t have to pay for Windows, their margins would be pretty good. Apple’s margin gap is essentially where the cost of its operating system would be if it were a non-platform-owning OEM. Apple’s margins can be viewed as the cost of the operating system, or where that cost might be. So to say that the company isn’t charging consumers for its operating system is a bit off.
8. You could argue that the software really is being given away at no cost, and that the margins are all hardware-based, but when you sell a device that has both software and hardware, you can’t be so puritanical.
9. So, finally, to directly compare the cost of Windows 8.1 Pro – $199 – with the cost of the Mavericks upgrade is slightly asinine, though Apple’s choice to make its update free was certainly a good one that will delight its users.
Apple’s decision to make the Mavericks update free accompanied its decision to drop the fees for its iWork suite of applications. Apple is a fan of iWork. Microsoft, as you might have guessed, is not. At all.
Frank Shaw, Microsoft’s head of corporate communications, penned a mild jeremiad yesterday against Apple’s plan to take on Office, which is a key business for Microsoft. Previously, Apple priced its iWork applications for $10 each on iOS.
So, let’s quote Frank before we move forward:
Surface and Surface 2 both include Office, the world’s most popular, most powerful productivity software for free and are priced below both the iPad 2 and iPad Air respectively. Making Apple’s decision to build the price of their less popular and less powerful iWork into their tablets not a very big (or very good) deal. […]
Now, since iWork has never gotten much traction, and was already priced like an afterthought, it’s hardly that surprising or significant a move. […]
So, when I see Apple drop the price of their struggling, lightweight productivity apps, I don’t see a shot across our bow, I see an attempt to play catch up.
All right.
For flavor, let’s sample some commentary from a different perspective. Here are a few bits from a FastCompany article entitled “All of the Ways Apple’s New Free Mac OS Hurts Microsoft Windows:”
Apple also decided to make its iLife and iWork productivity suite free, another headache for Microsoft, which continues to generate significant revenues from its Office suite of products. Certainly, Apple’s productivity suite doesn’t have the adoption rates of Microsoft’s Office and Excel programs. But by offering its suite for free, Apple–of all companies–makes Microsoft look greedy for deciding this year to start charging for Office 365 on an annual subscription basis: $99 per year. As Apple executive Eddy Cue snarked, “Others would have you pay a small fortune” to use their software.
Oh my. Let’s get into it.
1. iWork as a productivity suite has been an afterthought at best for as long as we can remember. Even at $10 per application on iOS, iWork was hardly world-changing. The Business division at Microsoft, of which Office is a part, reported that its revenues were $7.2 billion in the most recent quarter, for reference.
2. Will iWork becoming free directly harm Office revenues? Perhaps in the short-term on the Mac platform. I do not know how popular Office for Mac is. Free iWork could stunt sales of that Microsoft product, on Macs that are sold from yesterday on (current devices in the market, both OS X and iOS do not receive the free software, oddly).

3. However, Office for Mac sales, I suspect, are only a fraction of the Business division’s revenues, so the impact, for now, can’t be too large. And as Microsoft sells Office at its highest margin to business customers that are nearly always running fleets of PCs, the change to free iWork on Mac isn’t material.
4. All that adds up to the following: The danger that Apple is pushing for Microsoft is that it is lowering the cost of a software category from which Microsoft generates trucks full of cash. The Business division at Microsoft had revenue of almost $25 billion in its most recent fiscal year. If Apple can, over time, acclimate customers into not paying for productivity software, it could undercut Microsoft’s ability to sell Office at the margins it has for so long.
5.  Microsoft is guilty of this, as well. By bundling Office into its Surface 2 and Surface RT tablets, it is baking the cost of Office into Windows, which is already baked into the hardware itself. And, it isn’t doing so on a subscription basis. So, Microsoft is also devaluing Office. I’m sure it doesn’t enjoy that fact, but I also don’t see a way around it.
6. Microsoft is aware that the traditional Office business model is fucked. Software In A Box (SiaB) is over. Not in the Portlandia sense, but over in that it is a failing business model and one that must be replaced. Proof of that fact is simple. Adobe and Microsoft, two companies that made more money than Croesus off of SiaB, are both scrambling to move to subscription services (SaaS).
7. So, Microsoft has to at once protect Office revenues while transforming the products therein. Not that simple of a task when you need to generate about $80 million in daily revenue from the division. This is akin to rebuilding your car while racing it against increasingly nimble competition.
8. Microsoft, however, provided that it has margins of any strength on the Surface 2, can recoup some of that lost software revenue, as Apple does. This is where Apple goes to war. Its gross margins allow it to drive the marginal cost to consumers of its software products to a near uniform zero price point. Microsoft’s OEM partners can’t compete in the same way. And as Apple dings key Microsoft revenue lines, the latter has to find other areas of profit, such as hardware, where it already has deep competition from its own partners. That’s a tough spot to win from.
9. Still, Microsoft has something that Apple doesn’t: The most popular productivity suite in the world. And, it has shown that its new Office 365 product can connect with customers. Microsoft loves to crow that Office 365 as a whole is now on a $1.5 billion yearly run rate (that number is somewhat dated, Microsoft. How about another one, yeah?), and that the consumer-facing SKU of Office 365 now has 2 million paying customers. That milestone took about 200 days to reach.
Taking all that in pace, Apple is challenging a Microsoft cash-cow, but only on its own platforms, and only for new customers. However, demand for Apple’s productivity suite hasn’t been spectacular in the past, even at low price points, and Microsoft does have a competing suite in place. Microsoft understands that its legacy business model is dying out. It is reworking the Office suite to create new incomes, even as Apple subsumes its own productivity software into its hardware packages. Apple is therefore making its productivity software a component of its operating system, which it charges for in the same moment as its hardware.
That’s attractive. But given that Apple is not a top-five OEM, the iWork challenge to Office is really a mobile play. Can Apple take over mobile productivity? Free iWork for iOS is something that will blunt Microsoft’s current edge when it comes to mobile productivity, to some extent.
However, since the iPad lacks a strong keyboard option (that is first party, the third-party hardware I’ve used with iPads has been uniformly disappointing), precisely how much you can get done with free iWork on your next iPad isn’t immediately clear to me.
All the above illustrates that there is an incredible confluence of software, services, and devices in the market today, the three components coming together to support platforms and to attack other platforms. There is no simple answer to the question “What will be the impact of iWork becoming free?” We should avoid simplistic answers to questions that demand nuance.
We can synthesize by stating that Apple is certainly looking to lower the price that consumers are willing to pay for software. This means that Microsoft will increasingly need to follow in its footsteps by generating incomes from things like its own App Store and hardware.
The pressure of slipping software costs is already apparent in the Surface 2’s inclusion of Office. Though, large customers and their needs will mostly protect the Business division until Microsoft can figure out its next generation of services.
Apple is increasing the pressure on trends that Microsoft was already addressing. The question that remains is simple: Who wins?

Apple just released its earnings report for Q1 2013, ending in December of last year, with a solid hardware quarter overall. The iPhone dominated with 47.8 million units sold in the quarter, up quarterly and yearly, with Apple also breaking records with 22.9 million iPads sold.
The iPhone 5 saw its first full quarter of availability this period, as well as a nice holiday sales boost. Analysts had suggested earlier this month that iPhone 5 production orders had been cut on signs of weak demand.
22.9 million iPads sold is a solid increase from last quarter’s 14 million. It’s also a 33 percent YOY increase, up from 15.4 million last year. The iPad missed predictions last quarter.
Though Apple doesn’t break out specific numbers on various models, it’s fair to assume the iPad mini, which was available for the majority of the period, played a part in the increased sales along with the holiday spike. And let’s not forget, Apple also introduced an upgraded 4th-generation iPad with Lightning port alongside the little guy.
However, the iPad mini has more to make up for, as its gross margin is significantly lower than other products.

Apple sold 47.8 million iPhones over the three-month period, vs. 26.9 million last quarter and 37 million last year. That represents YOY growth of 23 percent.
Analysts believe that the iPhone may have already saturated developed markets like the U.S. and the UK, which are Apple’s strongest regions, which explains the production cuts.
However, Apple is rumored to be developing two versions of the next-gen iPhone, and one is said to be a budget model aimed at developing markets.
In terms of iPods, the new family of colorful iPod products has managed to breathe a little life into a flagging business for Apple. The introduction of the iPhone has most certainly chomped into this segment of the business, but Apple still managed to sell 12.7 million, up from 5.3 million last quarter, representing a YOY loss of 18 percent.

You really have to hand it to Jeff Bezos and Amazon, which seem to continuously defy reality — and gravity. Amazon just announced its fourth-quarter earnings, and if you listen to the press, you’d think it was another home run. And if you are watching Amazon trade after-hours, you’d think this is the most buyable stock since the last time MG wrote about AAPL. Amazon is up nearly 10 percent since the market closed and, as Reuters points out to wit, the stock hit a record high on January 25th.
In part that’s because, yes, Amazon is the Walmart of the Internet, an the e-commerce giant. Thanks to network effects, it’s impossible to ignore. In fact, I’m using it to buy a tinfoil hat right now. The other contributing factor is, of course, that Amazon increased its revenues, or global sales, by 22 percent to $21.27 billion in the fourth quarter.
That’s huge, right? The list of companies doing $21 billion in revenue in the fourth quarter isn’t long.
Cue the confetti.
Those who regularly have the distinct pleasure of listening to Amazon’s quarterly conference call for investors know that the company rarely says anything of substance in these calls. Usually, executives deflect questions, reading canned lines and sticking to the appropriate PR speak. But this quarter’s investor call may have been the shortest in history.
That’s probably because Amazon’s press release only tells one side of the story, and executives probably aren’t too eager to respond to any of those pesky naysayers. Here’s why: In spite of its $21 billion in sales, Amazon underperformed compared to analysts’ expectations. Of course expectations were high thanks to the usual holiday shopping bump for retail and e-commerce, but Amazon was expected to hit $0.27 EPS and $22 billion in revenues, and Amazon instead underperformed, coming in at $0.21 and $21 billion, respectively.
That may not sound like a lot, and Amazon executives clearly think there isn’t much to be worried about, especially considering the company has $8 billion in cash. That’s nothing to scoff at, clearly, but there’s also the fact that the company’s net income decreased by 45 percent in the fourth quarter and growth is slowing. Amazon saw just $97 million in net profits in Q4. Yes, $97 million. That would be a big win for a company with $1 billion in revenue, but I’m probably not going out on a limb to say that it’s a red flag when you’re doing $21 billion.
If you look at the profit/loss graph in Leena’s post from earlier today [also included at the bottom of this post], one sees that Amazon hasn’t tallied more than $177 million in profits … well, for quite some time.
What’s more, as Zero Hedge points out, it’s almost comical that Amazon’s stock jumped after-hours. The irrationality of the markets in top form. The stock shot up this afternoon even after Amazon lowered its top-line guidance, projecting sales of between $15 to $16 billion, along with operating income.
On top of that, Amazon’s physical book sales had the slowest growth rate it’s seen in the last 17 years. Of course, thanks to the new age of eBooks and its quarterly increases in revenue, Amazon has continued hiring, growing its staff to a record 88,400 in 2012. Meanwhile, global net sales saw the slowest year-over-year growth in recent memory, down 30 percent from Q3 and down 34 percent from Q4 2011.
But here’s the real kicker: As Zero Hedge has pointed out, the company’s LTM net income is “now officially negative.” From Zero Hedge, that means that “as of this moment, the company with the idiotically high PE has an even more idiotic N/M PE.” In other words, N/M represents the correlation between the company’s market cap and its net income is now negative. [See the last graph here.]
Paul Vigna of the WSJ also noticed this P/E horror today, saying:
For the year, the company reported a loss of $39 million, or 9 cents a share, compared to net income of $631 million, or $1.37 a share, in 2011. Incidentally, that means the company doesn’t actually have a trailing-12-months price-to-earnings ratio, since there were no earnings for the past 12 months.
Yep, you read that correctly. There were no earnings for the past 12 months.
HUZZAH! Hooray! Take my money, please. Take it!
For some reason, the fact that Amazon is dealing with 1.9 percent margins, halting guidance, slowing growth, earnings and income misses and tiny profits seems not to matter to investors. People continue to buy Amazon stock, and the stock market at large continues to push higher as the Fed continues dumping money into banks instead of lending. But, don’t worry, Paul Krugman says everything is going to be fine. Phew.
Well, you’ll have to pardon me, Paul, but I think I’m going to go against the grain on this one and offer the world’s slowest slow clap to Amazon while continuing to hoard all of my cash under my mattress and consider a move to Antartica. Next thing we know Bitcoins will be the new standard.
I know Jeff Bezos has a giant brain and everything, but it’s hard not to look at Amazon earnings, mixed with the overall macroeconomic conditions, and not feel slightly to moderately nauseous. Or like you need a strong drink.
More in Leena’s coverage here.
NOTE/UPDATE: Before the heavy, mediocre breath from the confederacy of dunces gets too thick, let’s get a few things straight. Amazon is an incredible business, offers extremely valuable services and has weaved itself into the very fabric of American (and soon global) commerce. As such, it’s part of one of the fastest growing market segments on the planet. I’m not suggesting Amazon is going anywhere anytime soon, nor should it. It’s not going to crash, lay everyone off and run around like a chicken with its head cut off.
Yes, part of the reason Amazon demonstrates such low profits is because of the amount of investment it has been pouring into innovation and infrastructure and diversification across what seems like 50 different markets and categories. That’s not rocket science. But therefore, no one should expect the company to be remotely profitable, right? Who cares, it totally makes AWS, geeks declare. And earnings shouldn’t enter the picture when you have a top line like that, right? 
No. I’d say there’s a very strong argument in favor of the fact that Amazon is going way too far in this direction and is heading for a reality check. 
Yes, Amazon credit for its focus on innovation. Case in point: Yesterday, the company launched Elastic Transcoder, a new service that “lets people upload digital video and put it into formats — h264, AAC and mp4 for now — that are usable on devices like smartphones and tablets, as well as PCs,” according to Ingrid. That’s a lot of free and cheap transcoding for the masses, potentially a threat to Zencoder and the Netflixes of the world. 
Amazon has an enormous distribution mechanism — enormous — and has come to represent the classic case of long-tail domination. It staves off its flagging original core business (book sales) by out-innovating in video, giving Netflix a run for its monies. Amazon is busy expanding the size of the video streaming market with its products, creating parellel models without having to appeal to Netflix (or anyone else’s) core user base.
But Amazon is at risk of over-extending. It doesn’t break out numbers for the Kindle Fire, even though we’re told they’re totally doing fine. No, they’re contributing to the losses, which is fine for the company if it makes money elsewhere. But it’s not doing itself any favors by trying to lock users into its ecosystem around a mobile touchpoint that isn’t really up to snuff, even if it elbows users into having to buy it as its other businesses mature around it. None of this inspires confidence.
As Seeking Alpha points out, Amazon is nearly one-tenth the size of Walmart on the top line and, “while Walmart numbers there have grown just 10 percent in the last two years, it has in fact added nearly $39 billion in sales” … in turn, “Amazon’s 2011 sales were $48 billion.” Yet another reason this is unsustainable. The higher the numbers get the more pressure there is to maintain them. Icarus flies too high, etc.
And, yes, AWS is a juggernaut. We get it. It leads among cloud developers, is a point of pride for Amazon (as it should be). Amazon analysts claim that it could be a $19 billion business on its own or worth $30 billion at an 8x multiple. Of course, many fanboys claim that this is where Amazon will make all of its money, in digital and cloud services like these where margins are higher. But nothing about that makes you nervous? 
All this is based on numbers Amazon doesn’t provide. It doesn’t break out its AWS margins and revenue, just to be clear. One analyst gives AWS 500+ gross margin points by 2015. Are you serious? And saying that when Amazon goes down and takes down a lot of familiar websites and startups with it, that it is somehow indispensable and therefore brilliant is just ridiculous. 
Sure, Amazon is probably making money on AWS, but how much? We don’t know. 500+ points? No way. In fact, if you’ve been paying attention AWS has proven to be pretty unreliable over the last year and there’s no reason to believe that its unreliability somehow gives it more appeal as Amazon tries to court enterprise customers. Why wouldn’t they choose Rackspace … or, say, Google. 
Sure, Amazon management looks brilliant because it goes against the grain and is willing to grind profits down to next to nothing for a long period of time to invest in growth areas and innovate. That’s great, but that can’t last forever. The fact that the majority of Amazon analysts consistently rate it a “strong buy” quarter after quarter is another sign that the motley fool momentum of its stock is bound to change. As Seeking Alpha notes, “the laws of economics deem that Amazon’s current business model is unsustainable and will continue to generate less and less marginal growth, to the point where we actually end up seeing negative returns produced by management.” 
You can only give the middle finger to your long-term shareholders for so long before things get hairy. I think that point is coming very soon for Amazon. But, hey, I’m just one guy.

If we had the answer to this question, life would be grand. Grander if we knew the reaction to the answer beforehand.
The moves in different directions for Amazon and Apple have been about expectations and guidance. Wall Street has higher expectations for Apple and ‘different’ expectations for Amazon. Wall Street wants Apple’s ‘gross margins’ to grow. They don’t expect Amazon’s ‘profits’ to grow. It sounds silly, but if Apple has reported lower profits and a huge gross margin increase the stock might have shot up. If Amazon had reported record profits today on decreasing margins, Wall Street might have panicked.
Learning the language of the market is not easy. Wall Street loves it that way. If Spanish or Chinese were easy to learn, every American would speak it. The stock market is all about supply/demand, earnings, expectations and mood. The financial media is about headlines. I have spent over 25 years investing and trading and the dirty secret is that survival is about risk management. The best of the best are wrong 50 percent of the time.
Apple and Amazon have been fantastic investments if you have owned them for the last 10 years. Recently Apple has been the ugly duckling of Wall Street. The mood has soured on Apple. It is in uncharted territory as the largest and most profitable company in the world. There is no possible way that Wall Street can predict the earnings, margins, or growth of Apple, let alone the mood of the market one year forward. But… they will try. They have expectations and they get set to spreadsheets.
Those that own Apple (I do) point to the cash balance and earnings and declare the market is rigged or broken (I don’t). Wall Street has stopped caring about Apple’s profits today. They were displeased with forward guidance. Growth rates have slowed measurably at Apple which is understandable for a company of its’ size. Wall Street is worried that growth is slowing and competition from Google and Samsung are taking a toll. Apple has given Wall Street so many wonderful surprises so magic has become the norm. Now that Apple is boring, they have run for the hills.
Meanwhile, Amazon has been able to avoid the ‘profit’ seeking eye of Wall Street analysts. Jeff Bezos has done a miraculous job keeping Wall Street focused on sales growth, market share, the cloud, and now with today’s announcement… margins. Amazon reported margins of 24.1 percent and that was the number that made Wall Street happy.
Next quarter things could change.  But I would keep an eye on the gross margin direction of Apple and Amazon until profits come back in vogue. Got it?

The growth of tablet sales has been outstripping that of more traditional desktop and laptop personal computers for a while, and now it looks like we are finally approaching the tablet/PC tipping point, where the cheaper, more portable tablet is becoming the de facto PC: 2014 will be the year that tablets account for 50% of all “PCs” shipped globally, according to researchers at Canalys. Leading the charge will be tablets built on Android — which collectively will account for 65% of all tablets shipped (185 million units) with Samsung at the helm. Apple, with its growing line of iPad devices, will remain the single-biggest tablet brand, taking 30% of the market — and, significantly, the most profitable.
Profit, in fact, takes priority for Apple over market share, Canalys argues. “Apple is one of the few companies making money from the tablet boom,” writes Tim Coulling, a senior analyst with Canalys. “Premium products attract high value consumers; for Apple, remaining highly profitable and driving revenue from its entire ecosystem is of greater importance than market share statistics.”
All well and good, but longer term, the company that keeps market share is the one that keeps mindshare. Consider Microsoft, which Canalys predicts will only have about 5% of the tablet market. “To improve its position it must drive app development,” writes Canalys research analyst Pin Chen Tang. Developers tend to go to where the most avid users are.

Canalys notes that 50% tablet share in PCs works out to 285 million tablets shipping in 2014. By 2017 that number will rise to 396 million units.
To chart how quickly the market is shifting to tablets, consider that in February 2013, Canalys noted that tablets accounted for only one-third of all personal computers shipped. For all of 2013, Canalys had predicting originally predicted that tablets will account for 37% of all PCs shipped, with some 182.5 million tablets out of a total 493.1 million units, although today it is revising that up to 40%. (I’m sticking to Canalys numbers, by the way, to keep it like-for-like, as other researchers will probably use different data sources and come up with different numbers.)
Given that Apple was an early mover and arguably established the very concept of a tablet market, what has happened to put Android in the lead? For the answer, look to trends in smartphones: Android tablet OEMs will control the market by sheer force of numbers (there are dozens of OEMs building devices on Google’s free Android OS), but also because they are being sold at a number of different price points, thereby tackling many different market segments in the process.
That is having a mixed effect in the PC market. Canalys notes that new tablets like the iPad Air and new iPad mini have helped Apple keep its market share up, and “will strengthen that position in Q4”, in contrast to other vendors who have seen their PC numbers tumble. However, longer term, its market share will decline because of the company’s focus on higher margins with premium-priced products. “Apple’s prioritization of protecting gross margins will see its PC market share continue to decline,” Coulling writes. “Apple’s decline in PC market share is unavoidable when considering its business model.”
This is already happening in some markets. Canalys notes that Samsung overtook Apple in PCs in the EMEA region in Q4 of this year, “and Apple will lose its position to competitors in more markets in the future.” Canalys notes that in Q3 2013 Samsung took a 27% share of all tablet sales. (And note, too, that a recent study released earlier this month from JD Power, the consumer sentiment researchers, put Samsung ahead of Apple in tablets for the first time, with a key focus on price.)
So where is Windows and historic PC king Microsoft in all of this? Canalys believes that Microsoft will account for 5% of the tablet market next year, with its acquisition of Nokia helping to push it closer to turning that market share around by turning the company into “a fully-fledged smart mobile device vendor.” Part of that will be about Microsoft removing some of the fragmentation in its own walled garden. “A critical first step is to address the coexistence of Windows Phone and Windows RT. Having three different operating systems to address the smart device landscape is confusing to both developers and consumers alike,” writes Tang.
If 5% sounds small, consider that in 2012, it took only 2% of shipments. Still, that’s very slow growth — with the question being whether we should consider this strong, oak-like slow growth, or just a general lack of interest in the product.
Longer term, we may be consolidating on a few platforms, but Canalys believes that price competition will cause further fragmentation when it comes to vendors and device makers.
“With the cost and time-to-market advantages afforded by their Chinese supply chain… small-to-micro brand vendors are eating up tablet market share. Vendors such as Nextbook in the United States, and Onda and Teclast in the People’s Republic of China ship more units than some of the major international top tier vendors in their home countries. The rise of small-to-micro brand vendors has proved that there is a demand in for entry-level Android tablets in every country and in every region,” writes Shanghai-based Analyst James Wang.
He believes that brands like Acer, Asus, HP, and Lenovo, with entry-level products at sub-U$150 price points, “have all entered the price war” but will find it hard to compete against smaller, local vendors.
That fragmentation will also spur consolidation. With companies like BlackBerry and Barnes & Noble already rethinking their place in the tablet market, “expect 2014 to bring a flurry of acquisitions, mergers, and failures as PC hardware vendors of all sizes struggle to maintain their desktop and notebook business while attempting to capitalize on a tablet market that will see great volumes driving limited value.”

Some good news for Nokia today: the company announced that it is exceeding guidance for Q4 sales after a strong quarter of sales for its Windows Phone Lumia line and its Asha low-cost smartphones, with sales of Lumias nearly doubling over last quarter to 4.4 million devices. It also noted that its operating expenses are also lower and that the two combined are helping improve the company’s operating margins. These are now expected to be between break even and positive 2%. This is significant in that it is a big change from previous quarters, where Nokia has had to warn the market that it wouldn’t be meeting original forecasts.
As a point of comparison, Nokia had originally estimated that its operating margin for the quarter would be negative 6 percent, plus or minus four percentage points.
The company also notes that the Nokia Siemens Networks did better than expected in Q4 and continues to be profitable. The company did not give revenue figures for the division but noted that the reasons for the improvement was the “strong” performance of higher margin product categories — 4G network equipment is one example of those — along with better-than-expected cost management. Operating margin is anticipated at between 13% and 15%.
“We are pleased that Q4 2012 was a solid quarter where we exceeded expectations and delivered underlying profitability in Devices & Services and record underlying profitability in Nokia Siemens Networks,” said CEO Stephen Elop in a statement. “We focused on our priorities and as a result we sold a total of 14 million Asha smartphones and Lumia smartphones while managing our costs efficiently, and Nokia Siemens Networks delivered yet another very good quarter.”
But operating margin will not hold to the next quarter. It expects Q1 operating margin to be negative 2%, plus or minus four percentage points. This is because of “competitive industry dynamics” that have negative impact on smart devices and mobile phones — that is, competition from Samsung and other Android handset makers, as well as Apple and the iPhone. It also notes that Q1 will be seasonally weak. And although Lumia smartphones continue to “ramp up” this may not offset larger consumer demand or the wider economic environment.
Nokia also said that Location & Commerce non-IFRS operating margin in the first quarter 2013 would be negative “due to lower recognized revenue from internal sales, which carry higher gross margin, and to a lesser extent by a negative mix shift within external sales.”
Going back to Q4, Nokia says that it currently estimates that Q4 net sales in its devices and services division were €3.9 billion ($5.1 billion), with total device volumes of 86.3 million units. Mobile phones accounted for €2.5 billion ($3.3 billion) of that, at 79.6 million units, 9.3 million of which were part of its lower-cost Asha line aimed at emerging markets and newer users.
Smartphones are also picking up: these they had net sales of €1.2 billion ($1.6 billion) with 6.6 million units sold, 4.4 million of which were Lumia devices. As a point of contrast this is nearly double what Nokia sold in Q3, where it reported 2.9 million Lumia devices sold.
Because Nokia is now selling smartphones both in its traditionally feature phone “mobile phone” segment as well as in the “smart devices” segment, it’s also breaking out total smartphones. These are now 15.9 million in total.
Other devices and services generated net sales of 200 million euros.
The full results for Q4 will be out on January 24.

Nokia exceeds previous Q4 2012 outlook for Devices & Services and Nokia Siemens Networks
Nokia provides preliminary financial information for Q4 2012 and preliminary outlook for Q1 2013
Nokia Corporation
Stock exchange release
January 10, 2013 at 15:00 (CET+1)
Espoo, Finland – Nokia today provided preliminary information on certain aspects of its fourth quarter 2012 financial performance and also provided preliminary information on its outlook for the first quarter 2013.
Nokia now estimates that Devices & Services has exceeded expectations and achieved underlying profitability in the fourth quarter 2012.
– Mobile Phones business unit and Lumia portfolio delivered better than expected results; and
– Operating expenses were lower than expected.
– Devices & Services non-IFRS operating margin for the fourth quarter 2012 now expected to be between break even and positive 2 percent.
Seasonality and competitive environment are expected to have a negative impact on the first quarter 2013 underlying profitability for Devices & Services, compared to the fourth quarter 2012.
Nokia also estimates that Nokia Siemens Networks has exceeded expectations for the fourth quarter 2012, delivering record underlying profits and a third consecutive quarter of underlying profitability.
– Strong performance in higher margin product categories and geographic regions; and
– Better than expected cost management.
– Nokia Siemens Networks non-IFRS operating margin for the fourth quarter 2012 now expected to be between 13 and 15 percent.
Seasonality is expected to have a negative impact on the first quarter 2013 underlying profitability for Nokia Siemens Networks, compared to the fourth quarter 2012.
Commenting on the preliminary Q4 financial information, Stephen Elop, Nokia CEO, said:
“We are pleased that Q4 2012 was a solid quarter where we exceeded expectations and delivered underlying profitability in Devices & Services and record underlying profitability in Nokia Siemens Networks. We focused on our priorities and as a result we sold a total of 14 million Asha smartphones and Lumia smartphones while managing our costs efficiently, and Nokia Siemens Networks delivered yet another very good quarter.”
Preliminary financial information for the fourth quarter 2012:
Nokia currently estimates that Devices & Services net sales in the fourth quarter 2012 were approximately EUR 3.9 billion, with total device volumes of 86.3 million units.
– Mobile Phones net sales of approximately EUR 2.5 billion, with total volumes of 79.6 million units of which 9.3 million units were Asha full touch smartphones.
– Smart Devices net sales of approximately EUR 1.2 billion, with total volumes of 6.6 million units of which 4.4 million units were Nokia Lumia smartphones.
– Total smartphone volumes of 15.9 million units composed of 9.3 million Asha full touch smartphones, 4.4 million Lumia smartphones and 2.2 million Symbian smartphones.
– Devices & Services Other net sales of approximately EUR 0.2 billion, including a positive impact from non-recurring IPR income of approximately EUR 50 million.
Nokia currently estimates that Devices & Services non-IFRS operating margin for the fourth quarter 2012 was between break even and positive 2 percent, which compares to the previous outlook of approximately negative 6 percent, plus or minus four percentage points. Devices & Services non-IFRS operating margin includes a positive impact from non-recurring IPR income of approximately EUR 50 million.
During the fourth quarter 2012, multiple factors positively affected Nokia’s Devices & Services businesses to a greater extent than previously expected. Preliminary information indicates that the main factors include:
– Within the Devices & Services business, better than expected financial performance in the Mobile Phones business unit and Lumia smartphones. In addition, Devices & Services recognized non-recurring IPR income of approximately EUR 50 million; and
– Lower than expected Devices & Services’ operating expenses, partially due to greater than expected cost reductions under the restructuring program.
Nokia currently estimates that Location & Commerce net sales in the fourth quarter 2012 were approximately EUR 0.3 billion and the non-IFRS operating margin was between 13 and 15 percent.
Nokia and Nokia Siemens Networks currently estimates that Nokia Siemens Networks net sales in the fourth quarter 2012 were approximately EUR 4.0 billion and the non-IFRS operating margin was between 13 and 15 percent, which compares to the previous outlook of approximately positive 8 percent, plus or minus four percentage points. Nokia Siemens Networks non-IFRS operating margin includes a positive impact from non-recurring IPR income of approximately EUR 30 million.
During the fourth quarter 2012, multiple factors positively affected Nokia Siemens Networks’ businesses to a greater extent than previously expected. Preliminary information indicates that the main factors include:
– More favorable product and regional mix in Nokia Siemens Networks. In addition, Nokia Siemens Networks recognized non-recurring IPR income of approximately EUR 30 million; and
– Better than expected improvement under Nokia Siemens Networks’ restructuring program to reduce operating expenses and production overheads.
Preliminary outlook for the first quarter 2013:
Nokia expects its non-IFRS Devices & Services operating margin in the first quarter 2013 to be approximately negative 2 percent, plus or minus four percentage points. This outlook is based on Nokia’s expectations regarding a number of factors, including:
– competitive industry dynamics continuing to negatively affect the Smart Devices and Mobile Phones business units;
– the first quarter being a seasonally weak quarter;
– consumer demand, particularly for our Lumia and Asha smartphones;
– continued ramp up for our new Lumia smartphones;
– expected cost reductions under Devices & Services’ restructuring program; and
– the macroeconomic environment.
Nokia expects Location & Commerce non-IFRS operating margin in the first quarter 2013 to be negative due to lower recognized revenue from internal sales, which carry higher gross margin, and to a lesser extent by a negative mix shift within external sales.
Nokia and Nokia Siemens Networks expect Nokia Siemens Networks non-IFRS operating margin in the first quarter 2013 to be approximately positive 3 percent, plus or minus four percentage points.  This outlook is based on Nokia Siemens Networks’ expectations regarding a number of factors, including:
– competitive industry dynamics;
– the first quarter being a seasonally weak quarter;
– product and regional mix;
– expected continued improvement under Nokia Siemens Networks’ restructuring program; and
– the macroeconomic environment.
Nokia will provide more details when it reports fourth quarter and full year 2012 results on January 24, 2013.

CloudFlare has secured a $110 million round of private financing, led by Fidelity, and participated in by a cadre of technology giants, including Baidu, Google, Microsoft and Qualcomm. The round actually closed last December, but the company decided not to disclose it until today. The company has now raised more than $180 million to date.
The quickly growing startup now operates in more than 30 countries, and, according to material provided to TechCrunch, processes around 5 percent of the Internet’s traffic. The company last secured a $50 million round in late 2013.
CloudFlare launched at TechCrunch Disrupt SF 2010, making them an alum of the event that your humble team is currently putting on. The company is refreshingly open about its finances, noting that it has been profitable since 2014, and currently puts up a gross margin of 75 percent.
A profitable company that is, at the same time, looking into international expansion might seem odd. CloudFlare is. The firm has grown incredibly quickly, helping it to attract the capital that it needs.
The company’s new influx of funds comes during a particularly frothy moment in technology. Discussions of a bubble are the current lingua franca of journalists, and the bête noire of budding capitalists. It’s worth noting that $110 million is a massive sum, but in the age of Uber’s billion-dollar raises, it isn’t out of the realm of normalcy.
The company’s expansion, however, does come with certain requirements. That the firm took funds from Baidu isn’t an accident. Doing business in China, a massive market for the Web and its larger requirements (the bread and butter of CloudFlare), entails more than entering other locales. Being a partner of a local technology giant in good graces with the government is never a bad strategy.
As CloudFlare announced last week, it has now entered the Chinese market through a partnership with Baidu. CloudFlare now has a presence in 17 Baidu data centers in China and expects this number to grow in 2016.
In a release, CloudFlare CEO Matthew Prince said there is an “inevitability around [their] business.” That is true to an extent, given the massive growth of not merely the desktop Internet, but the mobile web, as well. However, this particular inevitability is more a market pitch than a business secured; CloudFlare has competition, and its success will only attract more.
There are worse problems to have.
CloudFlare is joining us today onstage, and we intend to drill them on their finances, growth and expansion plans. To that end, the company has stressed international growth, and expansion in the mobile space. It’s almost like the Internet is global.

HotelUrbano offers hotel bookings and vacation packages in 35,000 destinations to a Brazilian user base of over 15 million registered users and 7.8 million fans on Facebook. The Rio-based startup closed 1.6 million travel bookings last year, generating over $120 million in revenue, and expects to double their revenue in 2013.
Insight Venture Partners led the $20 million Series C round, bringing the firm’s total investment in HotelUrbano to over $40 million. They are the exclusive venture capital investor in the startup since making a Series A offer three weeks into the company’s operation. Insight’s Bradley Twohig sits on the board.
Insight raised $2.57 billion earlier this year for their eighth fund in what is likely one of the largest raises for a venture fund ever. They have investments in Brazil’s e-commerce, software and social gaming verticals, including in HotelUrbano’s direct competitor, Despegar.com (Decolar.com in Brazil), a Miami-based online travel agency focused on the Latin American market, with about half its market in Brazil.
I asked HotelUrbano’s co-founder, João Mendes, if he thought that was a conflict of interest. “Insight is a silent shareholder in Decolar; they have about 4.5 percent of the company and no board seat,” he told me on a call from HotelUrbano’s Rio headquarters. “It’s funny because Accel is also an investor in Decolar and tried to invest in us in a previous round, as did Sequoia.”
Mendes says the co-founders parted with about 4 percent of their equity in the Series C based on an April valuation of about $250 million. The company has since doubled its revenues.
Brazil’s Exame says the co-founders, brothers João and Jose Mendes, and co-founder and Vice President Roberta Oliveira, have maintained an over 50 percent equity stake.
Exame also reported that HotelUrbano received and declined acquisition offers from travel behemoth Booking.com, and from The Carlyle Group, which controls CVC, Brazil’s largest tourism company. Mendes declined to comment on the acquisition offers, but indicated the co-founders have their sights set on an IPO and want to become the first Brazilian company to go public on the NASDAQ.
Brazil’s tourism industry represents about 4.5 percent of the country’s PIB (GDP), with revenues of $65 billion in 2011 and a growth forecast nearly doubling by 2021.
Only about 20 percent of tourism sales are made online, in contrast to about 60 percent in the U.S., but the numbers are growing. eMarketer pegs Brazil’s online travel industry at $7.5 billion and projects it will reach nearly $12 billion by 2016, when Brazil hosts the Summer Olympics.
When HotelUrbano launched in 2011, the only player in the online travel space in Brazil was Decolar.com, which focused exclusively on airline bookings. Mendes says he and his brother Jose Mendes saw an opportunity in the higher-margin hotel booking segment, which Amsterdam-based Booking.com dominates globally.
HotelUrbano started off as a collective buying site in the vein of Groupon and Brazilian-based PeixeUrbano, but pivoted to an online travel agency model within a few months to offer more flexible features such as choosing your travel dates. They reached $39 million in revenue in the first year of operation, $121 million last year and expect to double that number for 2013.
Mendes takes pains to frame the growth as aggressive, but healthy – perhaps referencing the growth hype Groupon and PeixeUrbano have suffered. The company broke even in the first quarter of this year, turned a profit in the second quarter and expects to be profitable for 2013.
Hotel bookings represent more than 60 percent of HotelUrbano’s revenue; the remainder is sales from travel packages. They have yet to expand into Decolar’s territory of airline ticket sales, although they are launching a dynamic travel package product next week that will allow users to create customized vacation packages with hotel and flight bookings.
Decolar, on the other hand, moved into HotelUrbano’s territory last year, expanding their product offering to hotels, car rentals, cruises and travel packages. They told Valor Economico their goal is to make hotel and travel package sales 40 percent of their revenue this year.
Mendes, while citing Decolar as their biggest online competitor, seems unconcerned. “They are trying to change their position from airlines to hotels, but they still have over 90 percent of their top-line revenue coming from airlines, which are very small margins.”
Offline, The Carlyle Group-controlled CVC dominates Brazil’s tourism industry. “It’s a model that’s dying in the U.S. and Europe but still strong in Brazil,” Mendes says.
“I’m optimistic because the online travel market is still very small in Brazil. And when you look at online penetration in any segment — retail, fashion, movies — when you see penetration improve over 20 percent, the next step is you see offline companies not doing very well, and online companies growing their share. So CVC is a big competitor, but we believe the online environment will be much bigger in the near future.”
HotelUrbano focuses exclusively on selling to the Brazilian market, although they plan to use the expansion capital to launch in other Latin American markets. The site currently offers hotel and travel packages to 35,000 destinations in 83 countries, and about 80 percent of travel package sales are to international destinations.
The inverse is true of hotel bookings. Mendes says about 90 percent of the site’s hotel bookings are for Brazilian destinations, where they are able to offer lower rates secured by negotiating directly with Brazilian hotels. They don’t have the same price advantage for hotel bookings outside of Brazil, where they use brokers.
An interesting point on selling to the Brazilian consumer: They like to pay in pieces. Only 30 percent of purchasers pay HotelUrbano up front; a full 70 percent opt to pay for their bookings in installments. HotelUrbano offers all bookings in 10 installments without interest, with a minimum installment of $30, and the average user pays for their booking in 5.2 installments.
Mendes explains that Brazilians pay upwards of 8-9 percent on their credit card carryover balance, so people like to purchase in installments. It’s part of the purchasing culture to see price expressed in fractions, whether you’re window-shopping in Ipanema or booking travel on HotelUrbano.
Mendes says the installment model gives HotelUrbano a big market advantage. “Installments are a barrier to entry for players like Booking.com because they use an agent’s model. You pay when you check in at the hotel directly, and the hotel pays a commission to Booking.com. So Booking.com can’t split in installments, and it’s a big barrier for them to enter the Brazilian market.” Whereas HotelUrbano collects payment from the purchaser — usually in installments — and pays out the hotels on net-30 or net-60 terms.
Another thing we know about the Brazilian market: They dominate social media. Brazil is the second-biggest market behind the U.S. for both Facebook and YouTube; Twitter says Brazilians are one of their five most active user groups, and opened offices in Rio earlier this year. The Wall Street Journal pegged Brazil as the social media capital of the universe.
HotelUrbano has exploited this cultural characteristic to the max. Co-founder Oliveira runs the social media efforts that have made HotelUrbano the most popular travel brand in the world on Facebook, with 7.8 million fans. HotelUrbano is the fourth-biggest brand among Brazilians using social media, behind only beer and fashion brands.
Mendes says the company has been committed to marketing on Facebook since day one. “We heard a lot of people say you can’t make money investing on Facebook or have a good ROI on Facebook, and we proved that completely wrong. But you don’t have to be in a rush on your Facebook strategy, and that’s the problem for most people looking for performance on Facebook.”
“We did things differently than just looking at ROI. We’ve tried to make people like us and interact with us, tried to understand their needs, and then we started to push things to them. If you consider the latency, the lifetime value, Facebook is one of our best marketing channels.”
HotelUrbano spends about $2 million a month across social media, search and promotional channels, with a marketing budget of $30 million for 2013. They push out monthly travel promotions at a low-to-zero profit margin to try to make more people travel.
“We’re not just looking at revenue, but looking at giving back. We have great margins, over 30 percent gross margins, but every month about 5 percent of our revenue comes from very low margin deals,” Mendes explains. “So if we help people travel on a product this month with no margin, we still have 32-34 percent margins on over 95 percent of our top line revenue. If we try to interact with people every month and deliver something very cool, they feel special, and we have repeat purchase rates and customer loyalty growing.”
Mendes says 95 percent of HotelUrbano users surveyed would recommend the brand to a friend, and they maintain an average Net Promoter Score (NPS) of 60 (anything above 50 is considered excellent). They look at repurchase rates as one of the principal indicators of client loyalty, but not the only one, and measure their marketing campaigns more holistically against lifetime value, cohort, NPS and repurchase rate.
The site has over 150,000 customer reviews, with plans to launch a TripAdvisor competitor later this year. They are also planning product launches in mobile (less than 8% of bookings currently come from mobile) and social, with the ambitious goal of launching the most downloaded app on Facebook.
They have also launched retail concept stores in Rio de Janeiro and the city of Campo Grande, and have seen the average booking jump from $600 online to $2500 in-store.
But the primary focus remains on the hotel business. Brazil is doubling down to build hotel capacity to accommodate the influx of millions of tourists for next year’s World Cup and the 2016 Olympics. Mendes expects a jump from 450,000 hotel rooms across Brazil to 800,000-900,000 in the next few years.
“Las Vegas gets 50 million tourists a year. Paris gets 100 million. Brazil gets only 5 million across the entire country,” Mendes says. “One scenario is that Rio will become what Barcelona became after they hosted the Olympics. This is a city that didn’t receive many tourists and today is one of the top 10 travel destinations in the world. When we go international, we can make people think twice about going to Cancun or Miami, and bring them to Rio, Florianopolis or Salvador.”
Referencing the rumored acquisition offers by Booking.com and The Carlyle Group, Mendes says, “Booking.com is the most valuable online travel agency in the world. They’ve become a global brand. A lot of Brazilians build great things but get comfortable when they have good market share in Brazil. That is not our focus. We want to build a global brand, because we don’t have a Brazilian Internet company that has become global yet. We want to be the first Brazilian company to go public on the NASDAQ.”
A law school drop-out who started his first startup in his garage, Mendes says, “We want to inspire other Brazilian entrepreneurs.”

Editor’s note: Jules Maltz is a General Partner and Parsa Saljoughian is an Associate at Institutional Venture Partners, a late-stage venture capital firm based in Menlo Park.
Paul Graham wrote a great post in which he defines a startup as a “company designed to grow fast” and encouraged founders to constantly measure their growth rates. For Y Combinator companies, he notes that a good growth rate is 5 to 7 percent per week, while an exceptional growth rate is 10 percent per week.
But 10 percent growth can’t last forever. If it did, the results would be astonishing. A company making $100 each week growing 10 percent weekly would generate $15 billion in annual revenue after just three years. Even Google and Facebook didn’t do that. The law of large numbers catches up to everyone.
So if the success of your startup is measured by your growth rate, how do you know if you’re growing fast enough?
At IVP, we researched this very question. We pulled data on Internet and software IPOs since 2010 and tracked the historical growth rates for each company for the four years before they went public and the year of the IPO. Some of the 70 companies on the list (like Groupon) grew incredibly quickly at first, but, as they scaled, they slowed down like a rocket ship getting pulled back down to Earth. Other companies (like HomeAway*) initially grew at a more measured pace but maintained this growth rate through their IPOs and beyond.
While every company and market is different, we aggregated the data to arrive at median growth rates at different revenue ranges (as shown in the graph below):
As the chart above shows, if you’re hoping to be a public company, you should be growing significantly faster (by percentage) the smaller you are. The median company with revenues between $0 and $25 million grew at a whopping 133 percent. As these companies scaled to the $150 million to $500 million revenue range, they grew at a more modest rate of 38 percent per year.
Additionally, the companies with the most successful IPOs (Tableau, Workday, Splunk, ServiceNow, Marketo*, LinkedIn, etc.) achieved growth rates at or above the median benchmarks in each of the years we examined before the IPO. As expected, the median revenue multiple at IPO for these companies was significantly higher at 7.3x. Conversely, the median revenue multiple for companies with growth rates below the median benchmarks in each of the years was only 3.8x.
We also learned a few other lessons:
Stay above 20 percent growth. Companies are only able to go public if they are growing quickly. Out of the 70 IPOs that we tracked in our analysis, 69 of them were growing faster than 20 percent in the year of their IPO, and 54 of them were growing faster than 30 percent.
All revenue is not created equal. The quality of the revenue matters just as much as the quantity and growth rate. The companies in our dataset that were valued most favorably at IPO have predictable revenue streams, high-gross margins and low customer churn. These companies generally avoid services and other one-time revenue.
Growth matters post-IPO, too. While we focused exclusively on pre-IPO data, these benchmarks hold true for public companies, as well. At the time of its IPO in May 2011, LinkedIn was valued at $4 billion. Since then, it has grown revenues above $1 billion at an 86 percent annual CAGR, which greatly exceeds our benchmarks. As a result, the company is valued at over $26 billion today.

Apple has plans to build a manufacturing plant in Arizona that will extend its ‘Made in The USA’ efforts beyond the Mac Pro and other silicon facilities it maintains in Texas. The news came via a release from both the state of Arizona and the company GT Advanced Technologies, which will produce sapphire material.
The multi-year agreement, which was reported by MacRumors, includes a $580 million prepayment that will get paid back to Apple over five years starting in 2015, and requires that GT maintains a minimum level of manufacturing capacity. The GT release alludes to the fact that Apple got a stellar deal on the glass, noting that ‘gross margins from this new materials business are expected to be substantially lower than GT’s historical equipment margins’, but says that the strategic nature of the agreement and the fact that it’s a recurring deal offset the margins. Basically, Apple came knocking and GT couldn’t say no.
Apple is purchasing an empty First Solar plant to repurpose it as a glass manufacturing center.
In a statement made to Pocket Lint, Apple said that “We are proud to expand our domestic manufacturing initiative with a new facility in Arizona, creating more than 2,000 jobs in engineering, manufacturing and construction,” further noting that “this new plant will make components for Apple products and it will run on 100% renewable energy from day one, as a result of the work we are doing with SRP to create green energy sources to power the facility.”
Apple’s nods to renewable energy apparently helped the deal, which will create 700 permanent jobs and 1,300 construction jobs.
“Apple is indisputably one of the world’s most innovative companies and I’m thrilled to welcome them to Arizona,” said Arizona Governor Jan Brewer. “Apple will have an incredibly positive economic impact for Arizona and its decision to locate here speaks volumes about the friendly, pro-business climate we have been creating these past four years. Their investment in renewable energy will also be greening our power grid, and creating significant new solar and geothermal power sources for the state. As Governor, I’ve worked hard to demonstrate that Arizona is open for business. Today’s news is proof that’s paying off.”
Apple uses sapphire glass for the protective covers of its camera units, as well as the home button on its latest iPhone. Earlier this year Apple announced that it would assemble its new Mac Pro computers in a plant in Texas. Apple currently cuts deals with its Chinese manufacturers that involve hefty pre-payments for both production and machinery costs. This deal appears to mark an extension of this kind of work to the US, where GT will manufacture the glass inside an Apple-owned facility. Though the deal notes that GT will work off the pre-payments, there is no mention about who will retain ownership of the facility, though it appears to be Apple.
Currently the sapphire glass is only used in a couple of components, but GT says that new furnace technologies will let it lower its cost and raise its capacity. It states this should let it expand its LED and specialty sapphire businesses, but doesn’t clarify whether that means Apple might switch to the harder glass from its current Corning mystery supplier parts.

We had a tip about, and have now confirmed, Intel’s latest acquisition: Kno, the education startup that started life as a hardware business and later pivoted into software — specifically via apps that let students read interactive versions of digitized textbooks.
“I can confirm Intel has purchased Kno,” a spokesperson told us just now. The company is not disclosing deal terms but we’ll hopefully going to speak to John Galvin, the GM of Intel Education, to get more details. Since then, Intel has published a more detailed statement from Galvin on its site, which points to how Kno will fit into Intel’s efforts to build up its business in the education market — an effort it is making both in <a target="_blank" href=" wider efforts in hardware and software.
He writes:
The acquisition of Kno boosts Intel’s global digital content library to more than 225,000 higher education and K-12 titles through existing partnerships with 75 educational publishers. Even more, the Kno platform provides administrators and teachers with the tools they need to easily assign, manage and monitor their digital learning content and assessments … We’re looking forward to combining our expertise with Kno’s rich content so that together, we can help teachers create classroom environments and personalized learning experiences that lead to student success.
To date, Kno’s apps can be accessed via its iPad, Android and Windows 7 and Windows 8 apps, and the main idea behind Kno is that the books are not only digitised but also include additional features to help students and teachers assess their progress, share information with others and generally get more engaged in the content.
“They are the same books, only smarter,” the company notes on its site.
Although the pricing of the deal remains unclear, we have learned that the entire Kno team will be joining Intel as a result of the acquisition — with one notable exception. Osman Rashid, the co-founder and CEO (who is also a co-founder of Chegg), will not be joining the company. His plans after the exit remain unclear; we’re trying to find out and will update when we learn more.
“He was definitely the figurehead behind it,” Galvin admitted later to TC in an interview, but ultimately the two did not see eye to eye about the direction of Kno under Intel. “[Staying on] was something that Osman and I talked about early in the process,” he said. “But where I wanted to take Kno and where Osman wanted to take it were two different things. His direction was to continue with a North American focus and I want to go international; and for us to go international, that’s about integrating with Intel’s sales teams, working on bringing this to new markets.”
Using Kno for an international education play is not an out-of-left-field idea. The two companies had already been working together in markets like China on textbook digitising initiatives. Kno was a natural partner that that Intel Capital was among Kno’s list of investors. (The company had raised some $73.4 million in funding since being founded in 2009, with Intel leading its Series C round in 2011. In that $37.5m round, Intel invested $20m.)
“It became more attractive to me to have them be a part of the portfolio rather than just a partner,” says Galvin. He pointed out the company’s ingestion engine as a particularly interesting aspect of the business to help Intel work more closely with the publishing world.
There are also some aspects that play into Intel’s bigger investments into areas like AI and natural language processing. “Kno is a very nice e-learning platform, and perhaps eventually also a natural language support platform, with an analytics engine. The capabilities are there. We can perhaps push them into areas they weren’t ready to go in on their own,” said Galvin. He also added that there is still some IP left from the company’s previous incarnation as a hardware play, though for now the focus will be on more software development.
Hardware is an area where Intel wants to grow its presence. From reference designs for processors to use in other OEMs’ tablets to its own devices, Intel has been working hard to make sure that it remains a relevant part of the gadget equation with the move to tablets and other mobile devices (it’s been an uphill battle in mobile devices).
In education specifically, the biggest chipmaker in the world wants to take on Apple and Google — or the iPad and the Chromebook, respectively. Again, this is an uphill battle, with Apple currently holding a 94% share of the school market in the U.S. (no surprise that Intel is looking internationally).
With this acquisition, it essentially becomes the software platform for Intel’s hardware shell. It’s the same motivation that arguably led Amazon to acquire an education company, TenMarks, last month. And it wouldn’t be surprising to see Microsoft next, says BenchPrep CEO Ashish Rangnekar. (BenchPrep operates in the same space.)
For all the positives this deal may bring to Intel, the same may not be said for Kno. Most of the funding Kno received was for its hardware business. Why? Because distribution is a really difficult problem to solve in the education technology space, and a lot of great products die because they can’t get to scale in time. 
But software is an equally tricky play because of margins. A few sources we talked to said that Kno’s gross margins weren’t exactly sky high, and though its product evolved and it continued to add great strategic partnerships, the business wasn’t blowing the roof off.
Rumors have been swirling for several months now that Kno’s principal investors have been pushing for the company to find an exit opportunity, and we’ve also heard from sources that this deal came together fast. It may not have been a huge financial victory for Kno or its investors, but ultimately Kno is better off in the hands of a company like Intel, which has enormous distribution scale behind it.

For those who haven’t yet heard of FormaFina, think of it as the Fab of South America. The e-commerce startup, which sells curated, limited-run collections of decor products in Argentina and Brazil, has raised a seed round of $1.4 million to anchor itself in the Brazilian market.
FormaFina’s investors include Redpoint eVentures — a Silicon Valley fund dedicated solely to Brazilian startups — IG Angels, El Paso Advisors, Start Capital, 500 Startups, and Plug&Play. Several angel investors also participated in the round, including baby.com.br co-founder In Hsieh and Hans Hickler, formerly the head of DHL US.
With its limited-stock campaigns, FormaFina is capitalizing on exclusivity as a growing status symbol among the new rich of Argentina and Brazil, particularly women. This is in contrast to luxury goods like Gucci and Hermes handbags, which are instantly recognizable and pricey but relatively ubiquitous. The site typically runs 10-15 campaigns at once, each lasting 7-10 days with about 10 products per campaign.
FormaFina’s goods are significantly cheaper than offline alternatives that are subject to sky-high real estate and import taxes, but that’s not something they play up, said CEO and founder Nima Pourshasb.
Hickler helped set FormaFina up with a courier service with big discounts on standard rates, which keeps costs low. Items range in price from $20 to $5,000, with an average ticket price of $200. Gross margins are at 30 percent now, but Pourshasb said he thinks they can increase that to 40-50 percent by the end of the year.
FormaFina is aiming to make a dent in the South American curated e-commerce space while it is still relatively unpopulated. In addition to attending trade shows and reading design blogs, the site’s curators are looking to similar sites abroad for cues.
“They look at what other curators around the world are doing, and they review what Fab does. We have a lot of respect for what they’re doing. They look at Fancy very closely,” Pourshasb said.
While One Kings Lane and Fab don’t ship to South America, Fancy has expanded its shipping capabilities worldwide. Fancy’s site is also available in 33 languages — Portuguese and Spanish being two — with an option to request the addition of others. Although that makes it a viable competitor to FormaFina, the latter has the advantage of being South American first.
That said, Pourshasb said that he has always thought of FormaFina as a global company.
“We’re interested in starting with Latin America and going into Colombia and Mexico,” he said. “There’s a huge demand in those markets. Our plan would be to look into going into one other market, not before Q2 of 2014.”
They are aware of the risks of expanding too quickly, though, as many have said Fab has done. Logistics of international shipping can be tricky, Pourshasb explained, and managing different markets at one time can prove distracting.
FormaFina plans to have an iOS app out for Q1 of next year to accommodate the 20% of users who are shopping on mobile.

Microsoft’s acquisition of Nokia’s Devices & Services division for $7.2 billion is a bet on emerging markets and a continuation of Nokia’s emphasis on “connecting the next billion” users. In order to make that strategy pay off, Microsoft has to figure out how to thrive where Nokia floundered. Feature phones were a key part of Nokia’s strategy, especially in emerging markets like India, where it recently announced 2 billion downloads from the Nokia Apps store. As worldwide sales of smartphones start to overtake feature phones, however, it might be a smarter bet for Microsoft to concentrate on creating low-cost smartphones if it wants those next billion users to chose Windows Phone instead of Android.
One potential strategy is selling off Nokia’s feature phone business. According to the PowerPoint presentation Microsoft made to explain its rationale for the acquisition, the company said the deal could create cost synergies of $600 million within 18 months after its close. But as Juha-Pekka Helminen, former Director of Strategy at Nokia, noted on Twitter, consolidating marketing and sales and supply chains would not add up to $600 million. One way Microsoft can achieve those savings is by offloading Nokia’s feature phone business, which is in decline but still making money. This would also allow Microsoft to focus more resources on tripling its current smartphone market share from 4% to 15% within five years, a goal it laid out in its PowerPoint.
In Nokia’s press conference earlier today, CEO Stephen Elop said that the acquisition will allow Nokia’s device division to accelerate its growth. In return, Microsoft can extend its service offerings to a far wider group of people around the world, using Nokia’s devices as an “on-ramp” to Windows Phone. Feature phones are still important in emerging markets because they are the first (and, in some cases, only) point of entry to the Internet for many users. But the landscape is changing–last month, Gartner reported that in Q2 2013 smartphone sales exceeded feature phone sales for the first time.
This was driven mainly by inexpensive Android-powered devices, which is troublesome news for Nokia. Nokia shipped just 61 million feature phones in Q2 2013, down from 83 million in the year ago quarter. But despite overwhelming competition from Android, sales of Nokia’s smartphones still managed to grow in that same timeframe, thanks to its broad portfolio of devices at different price points. Nokia’s Windows Phone-powered Lumia sales increased 112.7% in Q2 2013, according to Gartner.
As part of the deal announced today, Microsoft acquired Nokia’s Asha brand outright. If Microsoft decides to hold onto Nokia’s feature phone business, it has to convince current feature phone users to stay within the Windows Phone ecosystem when they upgrade to smartphones instead of turning to Android. Not only that, but Microsoft must also now compete with its Windows Phone licensees, including Samsung and HTC–another reason why it might want to sell off Asha and Nokia’s other feature phone lines while they are still profitable in favor of focusing on inexpensive smartphones.
All major U.S. tech companies that sell both software and hardware–including Apple–have eventually turned to emerging markets for growth when their business in domestic and mature markets began to slow, so it’s unsurprising that Microsoft sees its acquisition of Nokia as a way to gain a bigger foothold around the world.
After the failure of Windows RT, Microsoft is banking its business on Windows 8 and Windows Phone. Acquiring Nokia’s D&S division gives Microsoft a chance to execute its strategy for both operating systems in a more vertically-integrated way similar to Apple’s business model for iOS devices. Microsoft currently makes a royalty gross margin of less than $10 per Windows Phone-based Nokia handset sold. After the acquisition, the company says that figure will increase to more than $40 per unit, which in turn will enable it to invest more in the Windows Phone ecosystem.
Selling off Nokia’s feature phone business would enable Microsoft to pour more resources into developing smartphones similar to the Lumia 625, its first affordable 4G handset. Lower-price points are attractive to people living in countries where smartphone adoption is still in its early stages, while 4G accessibility is a selling point for developed markets. By releasing more devices like the Lumia 625, Microsoft can apply a two-pronged strategy to expanding Windows Phone’s market share in a bid to challenge Android’s dominance.

MoPub, a startup that helps mobile publishers manage their ad inventory, has been acquired by Twitter, giving the social network another route into building its advertising business, specifically on mobile platforms.
We’re hearing that the company was acquired for $350 million in stock and that Twitter won out over other bidders like ad network Millennial Media, which itself has been making more acquisitions itself, buying JumpTap last month for $200 million. We’re also hearing that if you look at the prices that Twitter shares are trading for on secondary markets, the deal could actually be worth significantly more.
Neither MoPub, Twitter, nor Accel responded to immediate requests for comment. (Update: both MoPub and Twitter have now confirmed the deal, but not the price. MoPub will continue to work with multiple publishers under its new owner, opening up the possibilities of how Twitter intends to grow its own position in the world of mobile advertising.)
If accurate, the deal is a significant acquisition for Twitter, which has been sharpening its focus on revenue generation — specifically by running advertising across its platform in the form of promoted Tweets, ad retargeting services and more. 
A MoPub deal would help Twitter specifically in the area of mobile advertising, an area where Twitter appears to be doing quite well already. Last year, Twitter started to make more money out of advertising running on its mobile platform than it did on its desktop product, according to this report in the WSJ based on stats from eMarketer. Twitter declined to comment directly on this trend or how much this signifies in actual revenue.
MoPub as a business works with a number of publishers to help them maximise sales and performance on their mobile ad inventory. For now, it’s unclear whether a Twitter deal would mean that Twitter would become the exclusive customer, so to speak, of this technology, or whether Twitter would use it as a way of branching out its own social graph on to other sites, and other Twitter clients. Given the reports that Twitter has been positioning itself to offer more location-based advertising, MoPub’s own activities in the area  of location-based mobile advertising make sense as a good fit for that strategy.
Twitter itself notes that it will “continue to invest in and improve” MoPub’s “core business,” specifically in the area of native advertising “across the mobile ecosystem through the MoPub exchange.” It will also use MoPub’s technology specifically like a dedicated client as well: “We also plan to use MoPub’s technology to build real-time bidding into the Twitter ads platform so our advertisers can more easily automate and scale their buys,” Twitter’s ad head Kevin Weil notes. “Our approach is to show an ad when we think it will be useful or interesting to a user, and that isn’t changing.”
The latter is a particularly interesting idea that furthers the idea of Twitter itself as a platform, and as a wider big data/adtech player.
MoPub was founded three years ago by Bryan Atwood, Nafis Jamal, and CEO Jim Payne, who previously worked together at Google-owned mobile ad network AdMob. They were incubated at AngelPad and raised money from AdMob-backer Accel Partners, along with Harrison Metal Capital, Jafco Ventures, and others. They raised about $18.5 million total. 
The company’s products include the MoPub Marketplace, a real-time bidding exchange that helped advertisers bid for impressions the moment they became available. Back in May, the company said that it has reached a $100 million revenue run rate. A source familiar with the business said the company has about a 25 percent gross margin. MoPub customers include WordPress, Flixster, Ngmoco, and OpenTable. 
Over the past few months, the company has also been rolling out updates aimed at making it easier for MoPub publishers to manage ads from multiple networks.
Update: CEO Jim Payne talked to me briefly about the deal, saying that he will become Twitter’s vice president of exchange. When I asked about how MoPub’s publisher business would fit in at Twitter, he compared it to Google and its ad acquisition DoubleClick: “Google was doing a great job monetizing their own properties, but in order to really be a significant player with scale, breadth, reach, and frequency [on other sites], they needed DoubleClick. We can provide that level of scale and breadth to the Twitter folk.”
He declined to comment on whether he’d been fielding offers from other companies, except to say, “Suffice it to say we’re really thrilled about the deal. It was a pretty easy decision to make.”

Mobile payments company Bango — provider of carrier billing services to the likes of Facebook, Amazon, Telefonica, Google, Blackberry, Opera and more — doubled down on its emerging market strategy. The publicly-traded company announced today that it has raised £6.5 million ($10.2 million) through a placing of 3,250,000 new ordinary shares on the London Stock Exchange at 200 pence per share, with institutional investors the main buyers in an “oversubscribed” offering. The funds, Bango says, will be used to expand its operations in markets like Brazil and India, as well as other parts of Latin America and Asia, and will commence trading February 26.
The move follows a deal with Telefonica, announced in January, to power carrier billing services globally. That deal will see Bango get a commission on transactions made on Telefonica’s platform, where users charge an app-related payment, or another mobile content payment, to either their Telefonica bill, or by deducting from a prepaid Telefonica credit. Telefonica, based in Spain, has extensive operations in Latin America, including Brazil.
But it also comes at a time when the company needs cash if it intends to invest in growth: in the nine months ending December 2012, Bango reported a loss of £2.4 million ($3.8 million); £1.3 million ($2 million) for one-off items. It attributed a bulk of that loss to extra investments that it had to make to be prepared for the introduction of BlackBerry 10, it said. It noted at the time that smartphone business accounted for 80% of consumer spend on its platform, with feature phones “reaching end-of-life.”
In other words, carrier billing services may hold a lot of promise but they are not paying huge dividends yet.
Bango says that it now has a reach of some 1 billion mobile users through its service, although “billable identities” — that is, actual customers or people who have passed through its network — is significantly lower, at 200 million.
Like many other companies in the mobile industry, Bango is looking to emerging markets for growth at a time when more mature markets are approaching smartphone penetration. But while smartphone makers see that as handset sales slowing down in developed markets, it means something different in mobile payments.
For Bango, emerging markets represent an opportunity because credit and debit card penetration in these economies remains low, making it a challenge for carriers and app store operators to sell paid apps and other paid mobile content.
That presents an opportunity for carrier billing, where charges are made directly to a user’s mobile phone bill, or by deducting credit from a prepaid account. This was also one of the main reasons why Telefonica inked its deal with Bango — to create a more frictionless way of enabling payments in Latin America specifically. That deal was not exclusive, giving Bango an opening to forge ties with more carriers in the region.
“We believe emerging markets represent an exciting growth opportunity for us, and are seeing increasing interest from key customers in these areas, in particular in Brazil, Latin America, India and other parts of Asia,” Ray Anderson, Bango’s founder and CEO, notes in the statement below. “This fundraise provides us with the resources to move forward in developing those opportunities and we are confident that the massively smooth user experiences enabled by our unique technology platform, extensive mobile network operator relationships and industry leading customers provide us with a clear competitive edge in the fast growing mobile payments industry.”
Specifically, Bango says that it will be using the new funds for three areas: financing further moves into emerging markets; strengthening its balance sheet to “demonstrate to key partners that Bango’s financial position is not being stretched”; and to provide alternative sources of financing “if required.” The company has been adding more funds to its reserves over the last year: raised £3 million in May 2012 for business development, and says that it has invested some £1 million “of its own cash” in the second half of 2012 to build up its IT and balance sheet.
At the end of December 2012, Bango reported gross margins of 3.7%, and net cash of £2.3 million ($3.6 million).
Full release below.

Introduction
Bango (AIM: BGO), the mobile web payments and analytics company, is pleased to announce that it has conducted a proposed placing with institutional investors of 3,250,000 new ordinary shares at 200 pence per share to raise £6.5 million (approximately US$10.2 million) before expenses (the “Placing”).
Reasons for the Placing and use of Proceeds
In May 2012, Bango announced that it was raising approximately £3 million net of expenses by way of a placing of new Ordinary Shares. Following that successful fundraising, Bango executed its plan to prepare for significant scaling-up in future transaction volumes; Bango made key hires to boost its executive and operational team, invested approximately £1 million in a major hardware and software platform refresh in its primary datacentre in order to be capable of processing significantly higher volumes of payment and analytics transactions and continued to innovate in its payment platform and analytics products.
Bango now holds more than 200 million billable identities and has a total reach exceeding 1 billion mobile phone users. Analytics transaction volume doubled again during 2012 and end user spend growth resumed again towards the end of 2012 and this trend has continued into 2013.
Bango is now witnessing increasing interest from key customers in emerging markets which could benefit most from operator billing (as credit card use is less prevalent in these markets). In particular, Bango sees opportunities in Brazil through its new relationship with Telefónica as well as with other mobile network operators elsewhere in Latin America. Bango has also spent some time with key customers and mobile operators in India and uncovered similar opportunities there and in other parts of Asia.
Accordingly, Bango intends to use the net proceeds of the Placing in order to be better positioned to take advantage of these opportunities and, specifically,as follows:
~ to increase its capability to underwrite emerging market opportunities. The Directors believe that a stronger balance sheet will demonstrate to key partners that Bango’s financial position is not being stretched.
~ to have greater capacity to fund further business development with a view to gaining more mobile network operator partners. In this regard, the Directors consider that the recently announced Telefónica partnership is potentially significant for Bango and they are keen to enter into further partnerships with other major mobile network operators. The Directors recognise that developing such business will take time and additional resources and they wish to ensure that Bango’s existing payment and analytics operations do not suffer as a result; and
~ to generally strengthen Bango’s balance sheet to permit alternative sources of financing if required. As noted in the recent market update, Bango has invested more than £1 million of its own cash during the second half of 2012 in IT infrastructure and the additional balance sheet strength could enable more cost effective alternative financing if needed.
Details of the Placing
The Placing is conditional upon, amongst other things, certain shareholder resolutions being passed by the requisite majority at a general meeting of Bango to be held at to be held at Bango’s registered office at 5 Westbrook Centre, Milton Road, Cambridge CB4 1YG at 2.00 p.m. on 25 February 2013 (the “General Meeting”). If the resolutions are not passed by the requisite majority, the Placing will not proceed.
A circular (the “Circular”) containing a notice convening the General Meeting will be posted to shareholders shortly. A copy of the Circular will be available at http://www.bango.com. Application will be made for the new ordinary shares to be admitted to trading on AIM and it is expected that dealings will commence on 26 February 2013.
Following the Placing, Bango will have 45,431,669 ordinary shares in issue and each share has the right to one vote. Therefore, for the purposes of the Financial Services Authority’s (“FSA”) Disclosure and Transparency Rules, the total number of voting rights in Bango will be 45,431,669. This figure may be used by shareholders as the denominator for the calculations by which they will determine whether they are required to notify Bango of their interests in, or change to their interests in, Bango under the FSA’s Disclosure and Transparency Rules.
The Placing has only been made to persons (i) falling within the description of persons that, if they were clients of Cenkos Securities PLC, could be categorised as a “professional client” or an “eligible counterparty” within the meaning of Chapter 3 of the FSA’s Conduct of Business Sourcebook, (ii) of a kind described in paragraph 5 of Article 19 or paragraph 2 of Article 49 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Financial Promotion) Order 2005 (as amended), and (iii) who fall within the provisions of Article 2.1(e)(i) of the Prospectus Directive and no other person may participate in the Placing or rely on any communication relating to it.

Shortly after market opening, Tesla shares (NASDAQ:TSLA) dropped 9.68 percent to 34.81 in the wake of yesterday’s earnings. The company disappointed investors as it reported a quarterly loss of $89.9 million, or 79 cents a share, compared with a loss of $81.5 million last year, or 78 cents a share.
Yet, revenue increased to $306.3 million compared to $39.4 million last year. Gross margin increased from -17 percent to 7.8 percent but operating expenses rose at the same time. The company couldn’t cover those expenses with its sales increase.
Tesla is still spending an important part of its revenue on research and development. That’s why the company is still not turning a profit. It’s a public company that acts like a private startup.
Investors are focused on short-term financial outlook. So shares are trading down today. Yet, as Tesla only expects to sell 20,000 Model S’s in 2013, the company is right to focus on research investment now. It can iterate quickly and this is a key advantage when competing with established car manufacturers.
Recently, Elon Musk got in an argument with The New York Times due to a review. Today’s downturn seems to be unrelated.
For next quarter, Tesla expects to report a slight profit. It would be an important milestone for the company.

Video ad network Tremor Video has filed for its long-awaited public offering. The company’s shares will trade on the NYSE at TRMR and it wants to raise at least $86 million.
Tremor Video, which runs ads on more than 500 Web sites and mobile apps, disclosed in its S-1 filing that from 2011 to 2012 its revenue increased from $90.3 million to $105.2 million. During that period, its gross margin improved from 35.2% to 41.7%, due in part to the adoption of its performance-based pricing models, while its net loss decreased from $21 million to $16.6 million.
Since its founding in 2005, Tremor Video has received a total of $116 million in funding from Canaan Partners, Masthead Venture Partners, W Capital Partners, Meritech Capital, Draper Fisher Jurvetson, General Catalyst Partners, as well as investors Jason Glickman, Mark Pinney and James Rossman. Its IPO will be underwritten by Credit Suisse and Jefferies.
Tremor Video is among several video startups that are anticipated to launch IPOs this year. Bloomberg reports that YuMe and Adap.tv have also began planning public offerings as they look forward to strong growth in the video-ad market this year thanks to a boom in online commercials.

Once again, news from a supplier is fueling rumors about Apple’s future product roster. This time it’s manufacturer Pegatron’s announcement that it will increase its number of workers in China by up to 40 percent in the second half of this year. The hiring blitz at the company, which produces iOS devices, has led to new round of speculation that a cheaper iPhone is in the works. 
Suppliers have told Reuters that Apple is developing a cheaper iPhone in order to target emerging markets such as China and India. The less expensive version of the smartphone is expected to launch by the third quarter.
Pegatron’s financial performance is closely tied to the Apple products it makes. Just yesterday the company forecast its biggest drop in consumer electronics revenue in six quarters due to falling demand for the iPad Mini. Pegatron said its second quarter revenue will decrease 25 percent to 30 percent from the previous three months. 
Other signs that Pegatron is expecting orders for a cheaper iPhone is chief financial officer Charles Lin’s disclosure that more than 60 percent of the company’s 2013 revenue will come from the second half of the year. Pegatron president and chief executive officer Jason Cheng said earlier this week that revenue from communication products will contribute up to 40 percent to the total in second half of 2013, compared to 24 percent in the first quarter. 
Apple CEO Tim Cook said last month that the Cupertino company will start rolling out new products this fall and throughout 2014, including devices in “exciting new product categories.” Though its unclear exactly what Apple will be unleashing in a few months, many analysts believe that it will launch a cheaper iPhone instead of a larger-sized “phablet” that would compete with Samsung’s Galaxy Note. 
A less expensive handset will allow Apple to compete with cheaper devices running on Android in emerging markets, but analysts’ opinions on how much of an effect a less pricey iPhone would have on Apple’s earnings vary widely. The company posted its first year-over-year earnings decline since 2003 in the second quarter, reporting $43.6 billion in revenue (up from $39.2 billion in the year-ago quarter) along with $9.5 billion in quarterly net profit.
Enders Analysis’ Benedict Evans said “a blockbuster new Apple phone that almost doubles unit sales and blows a hole in the middle of the Android market might only add 5 percent to Apple’s gross profits.” 
On the other hand, Morgan Stanley analyst Katy Huberty believes a cheaper version can potentially add another 20 percent to the 10 percent market share iPhone currently holds in China. “Even in a scenario of low 40 percent gross margin and 1/3 iPhone cannibalization rate (flattening legacy iPhone shipment growth, which we view as conservative, the iPhone Mini adds incremental revenue and gross profit dollars,” she wrote in a recent investors note.

Twilio, the startup that lets developers integrate voice, text and other communications services into mobile and web apps by way of a set of APIs, has stayed mum in answer to questions of when it might finally make the leap to go public.
But today it took a step that some believe could help position it for just that: the company has sent out a letter offering to repurchase Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock. The price offered per share is $10.179, with a maximum buyback of $30 million.
SecondMarket is executing the repurchase offer, which will expire on August 11, according to documents obtained by TechCrunch from two sources. Twilio declined to comment.
According to a report in May, when the company last sold equity to outside investors during a $100 million fundraise, the per-share issue price was $11.31, a premium to what the company is currently offering existing shareholders. That round gave Twilio a post-money valuation of $1.1 billion.
According to a document provided by VCExperts, Twilio has issued 13,173,240 Series A Preferred shares, and 11,416,062 Series B Preferred shares.
While share repurchases for early employees are not uncommon among older startups, what’s also interesting here is the insight on some of the company’s financials.
In February of this year, Twilio noted that it was adding $1 million in recurring revenue every seven days, having ended 2014 with a revenue run rate of $100 million. But like many quickly growing cloud startups, Twilio loses money.
In the first half of 2015, the company booked $71.74 million in sales, with cost of revenue of $32.32 million. Those figures leave a gross profit of $39.42 million for the period. Deducting operating expenses and other costs, Twilio had a net loss of $16.370 million in the first six months of 2015.
Yet over the past few years, Twilio has garnered slowly improving margins. The company had revenues of $49.92 million in the year to December 31, 2013; with those revenues growing to $88.85 million in 2014. The company had gross profit of $24.05 million in 2013, and $47.42 million in 2014. That leaves the company with gross margins of 48.17 percent in 2013, 53.37 percent in 2014, and 54.93 percent in the first half of 2015.
As of June 30, 2015, Twilio had $121.82 million in cash and cash equivalents.
The company has raised $203.7 million in VC funding from investors that include Redpoint, DFJ, Bessemer, Founders Fund, Union Square Ventures and others.
Post updated with the maximum buyback total, removing analysis of the potential size of the transaction based on the aggregate A and B shares that exist.

Apple has just released its fiscal Q3 2015 earnings, reporting $49.6 billion in revenue, $10.7 billion in net profit representing $1.85 per share. Compared to the year-ago quarter, it corresponds to a growth of 32.5 percent in revenue and an impressive 44.5 percent jump in EPS. Despite this impressive growth rate, shares are currently falling in after-hours trading — it’s a bit ridiculous.
Expectations were pretty high following Apple’s last two blockbuster quarters — the company reported the largest corporate quarterly earnings of all time on Q1 2015 largely thanks to the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus.
Fortune’s consensus among analysts was for Apple to report earnings of $1.81 per share on $49.50 billion in revenue, with both revenue and EPS exploding 47 percent and 34.6 percent, respectively; this is an insane growth prediction.
Apple’s own guidance from its last earnings release predicted between $46 billion and $48 billion in revenue, with gross margin between 38.5 percent and 39.5 percent. Apple’s guidance has been accurate for the past couple of years, except for the past two quarters. At the time, Q1 2015 was the largest corporate quarterly earnings of all time, and even Apple couldn’t predict that. While Q2 2015 wasn’t as big, it was largely above Apple’s guidance and the street’s expectations.
During this quarter, Apple also launched Apple Music. As the company opted for a three-month free trial, it’s hard to predict Apple Music’s success. But the company said that “millions and millions” of people are already using Apple Music. Read more in our separate post.
“We had an amazing quarter, with iPhone revenue up 59 percent over last year, strong sales of Mac, all-time record revenue from services, driven by the App Store, and a great start for Apple Watch,” Apple CEO Tim Cook wrote in the release. “The excitement for Apple Music has been incredible, and we’re looking forward to releasing iOS 9, OS X El Capitan and watchOS 2 to customers in the fall.”
This quarter, Apple sold 47.5 million iPhones, 10.9 million iPads and 4.8 million Macs in the quarter. Compared to Q3 2014, iPhone sales grew by 34.9 percent while iPad sales declined by 17.9 percent. Mac sales are up 8.8 percent. Read all the details about hardware sales.
The iPhone’s average selling price is now $660 compared with $561 last year. This 17.6 percent increase in the average selling price (despite the unfavourable USD exchange rate) is probably the key growth driver for the company’s gross margin.
International revenue now represents 64 percent of the company’s total revenue. Last quarter was a massive quarter when it comes to sales in China. It was Chinese New Year, revenue soared 71 percent. Many expect the Apple Watch to work well on the Chinese market, but the iPhone is still a massive success already, driving the company’s bottom line. Sales in Greater China grew 112 percent year over year — mind blowing. Read more on China in our separate post.
Minutes after the release, shares are trading at $122 in after-hours trading, 6.69 percent below today’s closing price. Apple has been doing incredibly well on the stock market for the past six months. Today’s miss as well as Apple’s guidance explain today’s correction.
Apple’s own guidance for Q4 2015 predicts between $49 billion and $51 billion in revenue with a gross margin between 38.5 and 39.5 percent. The company reported $42.1 billion in revenue last year.

Yumist, an India-based startup aiming to disrupt the daily meal industry, has landed a $2 million investment to increase its presence from three cities to eight.
The pre-Series A round was led by Unilazer Ventures — the fund from media entrepreneur Ronnie Screwvala — with participation from existing investor Orios VP and Silicon Valley-based investor Steven Lurie.
Founded in November 2014 by ex-Zomato CMO Alok Jain and food and beverage entrepreneur Abhimanyu Maheshwari, Yumist has a different proposition to Rocket Internet-backed FoodPanda or Zomato which focus on delivering from restaurants. Instead, Yumist targets the mass-market food industry with daily meals that cost upwards of 65 INR, or around $1. That’s more akin to street food, or the kind of meals that urban workers take during their lunch breaks.
Margins may seem low but Yumist said it handles its processes in house — it cooks its own meals, handles storage, delivery etc — which it claimed helps to save on costs and optimize its processes.
“Having come from Zomato and seen what’s happening, a lot of tech stuff is happening [in the food industry] but there’s also a large market for daily meals. People are very price sensitive and don’t want to spend more than a dollar,” Jain told TechCrunch in an interview.
“This market is twenty-times larger than the restaurant industry, but hasn’t seen any change over last five decades. Yet, if I need a cab, I press a button and get it. The consumer has evolved but the experience in the daily meals market hasn’t,” he added.
Yumist currently operates in Gurgaon, South Delhi and Bangalore. The team is planning to increase its presence in those three areas, and expand gradually to reach eight cities by the end of next year. Jain explained that, unlike others in the space, Yumist deliberately started out slowly.
“We initially tested our unit economics, and then tested scale. We’re in business to make profits and gain scale,” he said, adding that — right now — the company spends around 35 INR per delivery but plans to reduce that cost to 20 INR using technology to optimize its delivery teams.
Yet, with a lean team he said that they are capable of expanding each locations by 10-15 new ‘zones’ — small areas of service — per week, so they can grow their footprint within selected cities rapidly.
“After this round, we will still keep our heads down until March in our current three cities, and show that we can be gross margin profitable at a company level,” Jain said. He added that the company is close to introducing weekend meals, having recently expanded to serving dinners as well as lunches.
All-in-all, Yumist has 200 staff, of which 20 are non-operational and based at company HQ.

In one of the largest seed investments in the firm’s history, Sequoia Capital is committing to a $13 million round for Lemonade, a company that’s looking to bring the idea of peer-to-peer personal insurance to the U.S.
There is perhaps no industry more universally reviled than the insurance industry and Lemonade’s co-founders, Shai Wininger (a co-founder of the jobs marketplace Fiverr) and Daniel Schreiber (the former president of Powermat), view that as a perfect opportunity to come into the U.S. with a potentially disruptive business.
They’re not the first company to bring the notion of peer-to-peer payments to insurance. London-based Guevara, which offers peer-to-peer car insurance, and Friendsurance, a Berlin-based company selling peer-based personal and casualty insurance, have both come to market with variations on the theme of bringing concepts of the sharing economy to insurance.
And while Lemonade chief executive Daniel Schreiber is mum on the types of products his company will offer, the business models Friendsurance and Guevara are pursuing may offer some hints for what’s to come from Lemonade.
Both companies allow policy owners to form small groups, Premiums are paid into a cash-back pool which allows members of the group to get money back at the end of the year (if they don’t file any insurance claims).
It’s one way to solve the moral hazard that’s at the heart of how insurers make money, and why they’re so detestable to the general public.
Since insurers use non-payment of claims as a profit center, the scales are weighted for the insurers to screw their customers out of contracts from the beginning. It’s this issue that Lemonade and its European counterparts are aiming to change.
“We are building an insurance company fully vertically integrated from the ground up to rethink some of the building blocks of the industry,” says Schreiber (no relation).
Based in New York, the company currently has 15 people on staff, including, Schreiber assured me, some titans of the insurance industry that he just. couldn’t. talk. about.
Schreiber and Wininger began working together about a year-or-so ago through the introduction of a mutual friend.
The company cites estimates that the property and casualty insurance industry generates $1 trillion of gross margins annually, and those numbers are hard for investors to ignore.
“It is very unusual for a company to receive $13 million in an initial round of funding,” said Haim Sadger, Partner at Sequoia Capital, in a statement. “But it is rarer still to find such accomplished founders tackling such a sizable industry… We’re bettingLemonade will transform the insurance landscape beyond recognition. It is one to watch.”

Today Dell subsidiary SecureWorks filed to go public, showing expanding revenue, and ramping losses. Dell, then a public company, acquired SecureWorks in 2011 for a reported $612 million. TechCrunch reported in October that SecureWorks had filed for an IPO privately.
The company’s S-1 filing, released today, fits into that timing.
Before we get into the numbers, keep in mind the moving parts. Dell and EMC are currently in deal dance worth around $67 billion. That, and EMC owns most of VMWare, which may stay public in a sense following the transaction, but may not. Oh, and there is fresh confusion regarding the how Dell and VMWare will interact.
If that all seems like a bit much, it’s fair to say that the current mix of financial and corporate movements inherent to the above are past the point of being arcane, and border on the asinine. The simple version is that Dell went private, it’s buying EMC, one subsidiary will remain partially public, perhaps, and another is being spun out. That last company is SecureWorks.
All that aside, the SecureWorks IPO has two interesting components: Its increasing rate of lossmaking, and its place in the larger Dell-EMC transaction.
SecureWorks’ S-1 filing contains quite a lot of language regarding its offering, and how the company’s assets were part of its corporate parents’s going private. However, in light of the offerings, things have changed.
Here’s SecureWorks on the prior situation:
Upon the completion of Dell Inc.’s going-private transaction, we guaranteed repayment of certain indebtedness incurred by Dell to finance the transaction and pledged substantially all of our assets to secure.
That is no longer the case. Here’s what’s going on now, in the wake of the proposed IPO:
Following this offering, all of our shares of common stock held by Dell Marketing L.P., an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Dell Inc. and Denali, or by any other subsidiary of Denali that is a party to the debt agreements, will be pledged to secure repayment of the foregoing indebtedness.
Going private is hard to do.
The filing goes on to note that even after the IPO, the company will not be independent, something that relates at least mildly to the situation of VMWare. Here’s SecureWorks:
Denali will continue to control us following this offering, and will be able to exercise control over all matters requiring approval by our stockholders, including the election of our directors and approval of significant corporate transactions.
Denali is the holding company that was created to take Dell private. Given that level of non-control for shareholders that may buy into its offering, it could be that appetite for SecureWorks’ equity will be depressed.
All that corporate bullshit aside, let’s dig into the numbers, which are far easier to gist and understand. First up, revenue expansion, comparing the first three quarters of 2015 (calendar), and 2014 (calendar):
So far, all good. Next up, gross margin off of that revenue, comparing the same time periods:
Which, after pairing the above numbers with expenses, the following pair of losses, again comparing 9 months to 9 months:
Those figures are less good. In short, while SecureWorks has shown both expansion in its top line, and gross margin, it also posted increasing losses. Investors have shown smaller appetite for company’s going public that fail to show falling losses and increasing revenues.
The company’s rate of loss is also troublesome when set next to its current cash position. Includin cash equivalents, SecureWorks has a slim $39.4 million in total cash. That figure will rise, of course, if its IPO happens has planned. The company listed a generic, $100 million offering total in its S-1, a sum that is usually employed as a placeholder for a later, more specific figure.
Up next for SecureWorks is pricing, and the like. But it will be more than interesting to see how investors react to the offering. If it fails to succeed, the IPO window could shut another inch.
SecureWorks competes with companies such as FireEye, Palo Alto Networks, and Cisco.

Ezra Galston is a venture capitalist with Chicago Ventures. 
One of the great promises of the Internet — a democratic, transparent, open network that would disintermediate entrenched industries, remove fee-taking middlemen and thereby lower the costs of goods — has seemingly been realized.
Priceline and Expedia mostly killed travel agents; Prosper and Avant are fast disrupting bank loan officers; and the car salesman has been diminished in favor of eBay, Autotrader and Craigslist.
And yet, just as surely as we thought they were gone for good, middlemen have come surging back to life — rebranded as our best friends: the personal concierge.
Case in point, personal shoppers were once a luxury — a sign of elite class and prestige. No longer: Hundreds of thousands of consumers are now communicating with personal stylists (or data-driven human/artificial intelligence hybrids) via next-gen fashion platforms such as Trunk Club and Stitch Fix — two platforms with demonstrative value (Trunk Club was acquired more than a year ago for $450 million, and few experts would reject Stitch Fix’s $300 million recent valuation).
And while fashion is an obvious use case, the concierge economy is thriving, spanning verticals from wellness to design, with a whole host of broad-based horizontal concierge services also trying to impress their worth.

 
 
The logical question is: why? Given all the advantages of a frictionless, democratic playing field, why are concierge services suddenly surging in popularity? I see three likely explanations: Amazon, too many SKUs and customer acquisition.
Amazon. If you sell practically any physical good online, Amazon, the Internet’s most powerful retailer, is a perpetual threat. With their distribution, leverage and logistics expertise, they have the wherewithal to undercut on price, and process and deliver products faster than practically any startup — not to mention, they can operate at a loss if necessary.
So where is Amazon exposed? On a services level.
Amazon’s operating margins — already tight at 1.3 percent — don’t allow for much room to train and mobilize a large human concierge force. Which means that building a human-focused, relationship-driven personalization platform actually provides for a tangible differentiator against Amazon — one of the few ways to effectively compete against the giant (and, perhaps more importantly, one of the few ways to build defensibility in a commerce segment traditionally dependent on “brand” as its only de facto moat).
One further point: Amazon is predominantly a destination for directed search – either on a specific product or specific category basis. But as purchasing increasingly shifts to mobile, it turns out that it continues to be difficult to search, discover and catalogue individual items. Concierges – especially when leveraged via a mobile interaction point – reduce that friction and enable a new purchasing behavior.
Too Many SKUs. We exist in a world of overwhelm. That overwhelm via multi-tasking is affecting how we learn and think, and the overwhelm via optionality and availability of information is also affecting how we process, “shatter[ing] focus” and deferring decision making as long as possible.
The problem of information overload was initially solved via curation, the mid-point on the spectrum in reduction of cognitive noise:

But based on the hyper-growth of concierge-facilitated platforms, it appears that curation doesn’t go far enough for the emerging set of millennial buyers — they demand even more assistance and personalization than before.
The question operators and investors should be asking is not whether consumers are connecting with digital assistants, but rather, at what point will we actually acquire too many? Therein lies the threat of repeating the cycle of cognitive overwhelm and forcing the next iteration of the operator/customer relationship.
Customer Acquisition. One of the curiosities of the concierge resurgence is that it may have opened the door for the next generation of customer acquisition.
The middlemen — when incentivized via a pay-for-performance model — actually become de facto customer acquisition agents for the company, serving as outbound salespeople. Trunk Club was one of the innovators of this model and our portfolio company, LGS, has leveraged it with great success.
It replicates much of the power/incentives of a multi-level-marketing (MLM) model, without the pyramid-like upfront capital commitments and obligations. MLM is a powerful model (Herbalife is one example), but social selling can generate abusive aggressiveness, poor customer relationships and low return-purchase rates. The concierge model is instead formulated as an expert/amateur relationship.
A concierge-turned-salesperson model isn’t a fit for all verticals, and it also can’t be as well-leveraged by hybrid AI assistants. But it does solve some of the scalability concerns that most consumer businesses experience once traditional digital channels (Facebook, Google) begin underperforming.
Until recently, there was a strong hypothesis that a thriving, active community would unlock an unprecedented ability to facilitate native transactions. Andreessen Horowitz General Partner Chris Dixon, when announcing his investment in Soylent, noted:
“He [John Borthwick] said he was interested in companies that appear to be focused on selling X but are really online communities that happen to make money selling X. This helps explain why many investors are confused by the sustained success of these companies. One example he cited was GoPro. Many investors decided not to invest in GoPro because they saw it as a camera company, and camera companies generally get quickly commoditized.”
However, investors who properly understood GoPro saw it primarily as a highly engaged community of sports enthusiasts, something that is very hard for competitors to replicate.
And yet, at least on a macro scale, the presumed value is very much in doubt.
Last month, it was reported that native buy ads on Pinterest during the holiday season did not meet expectations:
“The company [Pinterest] began inserting Buyable Pins into its iPhone app in late June, and just added the feature to its Android app in early November. The company says more than 10,000 merchants have joined the program, including big retailers and brands like Macy’s, Nordstrom, Neiman Marcus, Cole Haan and Tory Burch, but at least one of these big partners is seeing fewer than 10 purchases a day on Pinterest, according to a person with direct knowledge of the sales figures. This source and another also said that Pinterest insiders have privately admitted to being disappointed with early sales numbers.”
According to the same report, results are similarly disappointing at Twitter and Facebook. One-time startup darling, community-leveraged shopping portal Polyvore was acquired by Yahoo in 2015 for $200 million — a healthy price to be sure, but certainly lower than once hoped.
Even GoPro, noted by Dixon as a community outlier, has lost nearly 75 percent of its enterprise value in the public markets over the past 12 months. True, it trades at a premium to commodity manufacturers, but it appears its community purchasing may not be as strong as once imagined.
Nevertheless, transactional communities with more vertical specificity (such as Soylent) outperform bare-bones e-commerce. And it is clearly the very early innings in Pinterest and Twitter’s efforts to sell products directly through their platforms. Don’t be surprised to see the larger horizontal community players continue to struggle, and ultimately acquire companies in the concierge space in order to boost their conversions, order sizes and frequency.
The upside of human-driven assistant/concierge services is that in most scenarios, they add value to an end-user experience. The downside is that they add material costs to a company’s P&L.
Take, for example, any of the listed wellness apps (Rise, Talkspace, Big Health, etc.), which, if operated on a purely software basis would boast 80-90 percent gross margins. But a human-focused component affects that in one of two ways:
Given those two options, it’s clear why a hybrid AI/machine learning model is the holy grail for several verticals — replicating the level of personalized service while minimizing overhead labor costs and maintaining extraordinary software-level gross margins.
That said, it is still unclear if hybrid AI assistants can provide an end-user experience powerful enough to materially affect purchasing, conversion and frequency.
For the time being, within the fully human-powered services, the winning business models will be ones that can hire relatively inexpensive, untrained people who can then be empowered via software or leveraged workflows to deliver a meaningfully improved end-user experience.
This has the added benefit of yielding greater supply/expert-side scalability, in that the pool of potential concierges is far larger (if performance does not require deep expertise) and the level of consistency, even across expertise levels, will be more stable.
Startups trying to wedge into the market using a high level of service need to be highly cognizant of, and focused on, controlling costs. Especially as the investor market continues transitioning away from high cash burn models, obsessive attention on how to deliver a high-quality experience, deepening long-term scalability and leveraging lower-cost labor will yield many compelling outcomes.

The shift away from desktop PCs to smartphones and other smaller computing devices is having a big impact on a major player in the PC market. Chipmaker Intel today lowered its revenue expectations by $900 million for its Q1 earnings that will come out on April 14. It now says Q1 sales will be $12.8 billion, “plus or minus $300 million,” versus earlier guidance of $13.7 billion, “plus or minus $500 million.” It says the change was made because of weak demand for desktop PCs and economic conditions in specific markets like Europe.
“The change in revenue outlook is a result of weaker than expected demand for business desktop PCs and lower than expected inventory levels across the PC supply chain,” the company writes. “The company believes the changes to demand and inventory patterns are caused by lower than expected Windows XP refresh in small and medium business and increasingly challenging macroeconomic and currency conditions, particularly in Europe.” It added that its data center business is “meeting expectations” but it also cancelled all other outlook metrics until its earnings release.
The slower uptake in a Windows refresh is likely to have a knock-on effect for others in the PC hardware industry as well, as they too will have been depending on people upgrading their computers to keep up with operating system software. It will be interesting too to see the impact on Microsoft, as it implies that it will also be seeing slower-than-expected sales of its newer Windows software.
The company has been putting investment into areas like intelligent computing and wearables, in part to offset potential declines in other parts of its business, but also to help build out products and markets where its processors can live in the future.
This follows on from the company’s Q4 2014 earnings, when Intel disappointed Wall Street with its initial $13.7 billion outlook that already fell below their expectations. Currently the stock is trading at just over 4% below its opening price in the wake of today’s notice, at around $30.97 per share.
The PC business has been in a long decline for several quarters now, with Gartner among those predicting that tablets would overtake them sometime this year. However, as the tablet market has also apparently seen a levelling out of growth, it’s revised the outlook and even noticed a small uptick for sales of the larger computers.
Intel’s statement comes at a time when major companies are pressing ahead with smaller and lighter computers that are neither desktop PCs nor tablets or smartphones. Apple’s new MacBook — while inspiring some snarky incredulity — are doing away with ever more ports and other extras as it strives to distill the most useful parts of a computer for users. And yesterday Google debuted its newest Pixel Chromebook, its own take on keyboard-friendly computing for the future.
Intel further said it is holding gross margins, specifically the mid-point of the gross margin range to remain at 60%, “plus or minus a couple of percentage points, as lower PC unit volume is offset by higher platform average selling prices.” Expectations for R&D and MG&A spending and depreciation in the first quarter remain unchanged, it said. “All other expectations have been withdrawn and will be updated with the company’s first-quarter earnings report on April 14.”
The revisions do not include “business combinations, asset acquisitions, divestitures, strategic investments and other significant transactions that may be completed after March 12,” the company noted.

Today following the bell, Microsoft reported its fiscal third quarter financial results, including revenue of $21.7 billion and earnings per share of $0.61. The street had expected Microsoft to earn $0.51 per share on revenue of $21.06 billion.
Microsoft, up a point in regular trading, is now up just under three percent in after-hours trading following its earnings beat.
Compared to its year-ago fiscal third quarter, Microsoft’s revenue’s grew 6 percent. The company had operating income of $6.6 billion, and gross margin of $14.6 billion. Microsoft wrapped up the fiscal period with cash and equivalents of $95.4 billion.
To understand the company’s quarter, we’ll proceed in pieces. First up hardware, then cloud, then Office, and then Windows. That’s Microsoft these days, three platforms and some gadgets.
Microsoft reported $713 million in Surface revenue during its fiscal third quarter, up 44 percent from the year-ago period, if under a holiday-powered fiscal second quarter for the company. The company sold 8.6 million Lumia phones, generating a total of $1.4 billion in top line from its handset business.
Microsoft did not break out Xbox sales numbers, instead citing a slightly lame Xbox Live usage metric.
Microsoft’s Office 365 product had a huge quarter with consumers, growing 35 percent compared to the sequentially preceding quarter to 12.4 million subscribers.
Search ad incomes at Microsoft grew by 21 percent. I presume that that means that Bing is still on its promised path to stop losing money.
The company’s “Commercial Cloud” revenue grew 106 percent compared to the year-ago period, to an annualized run rate of $6.3 billion, up from $5.5 billion in the sequentially preceding fiscal quarter. That $800 million accretion is a 14.5 percent increase on a sequential quarter basis.
Windows OEM revenue fell 19 percent from the ‘Pro’ space, as last year the end of support for Windows XP drove sales of Windows itself. Windows volume licensing itself fell 2 percent. Windows OEM revenue from consumers dropped a steeper 26 percent, due to what Microsoft calls “inventory drawdown and ongoing mix shift to opening price point devices.”
Obviously, with Windows 10 just around the corner, Microsoft is likely less focused on its short-term Windows 8.x revenues than its future platform, but Windows top line remains a very important revenue well for the firm.
Total Office Commercial revenue actually fell in the quarter by 2 percent — it grew a point if you hold currency rates steady from a year ago — which Microsoft explains by saying the following: “transactional revenue was impacted by the continued transition to Office 365 and declines in business PC sales following the XP refresh cycle.” Again, the specter of XP remains valid a year after its saw its plug pulled.
A strong quarter from Microsoft, with better-than-expected revenue growth and profitability buttressed by quickly growing cloud revenues from both consumers, and business customers. The share price bump that Microsoft is currently enjoying should be held in contrast to the 9 percent it fell the last time that it reported earnings.

Intel reported its first-quarter financial performance today following the bell, including revenue of $12.8 billion, and per-share profit of $0.41. The street had expected $12.9 billion in revenue, and $0.41 in per-share profit. Intel is up around 3 percent in after-hours trading.
The company expects to generate $13.2 billion in the second quarter leading to a gross margin of 62 percent and a tax rate of around 20 percent. Those figures are improvements on the company’s most recent quarter, when it had a gross margin of 60.5 percent and a tax rate of a far steeper 25.5 percent.
Given those upward corrections, Intel could be working toward stronger per-share profit in the period. The street expects Intel to generate $0.48 in profit per share on $13.51 billion in revenue in the quarter.
Intel missed on revenue in its concluded quarter, and its estimates for the current quarter are also under expectations. However, the company’s consistent increase in its gross margin could indicate stronger future cash flows, lessening the need for raw revenue growth.
For its first quarter, Intel was blunt: “PC business down […] Client Computing Group revenue of $7.4 billion, down 16 percent sequentially and down 8 percent year-over-year.” That doesn’t bode well for other players in the PC space, including Microsoft, HP and the other usual suspects. Intel has long been a functional bellwether for the PC market.
Intel’s Data Center Group saw its top line expand 19 percent compared to the year-ago quarter, while the company’s Internet of Things Group picked up 11 percent more revenue than last year’s first quarter. Intel remains a company in transition away from the primal past of the PC’s fading hegemony. And it’s doing so while boosting implied gross profit. Investors seem at least mildly enthused.

Apple has just released its fiscal Q2 2015 earnings, reporting $58 billion in revenue, $13.6 billion in net profit representing $2.33 per share. Compared to the year-ago quarter, it corresponds to a growth of 27.2 percent in revenue, and an impressive 40.4 percent jump in EPS (adjusted for the 7-for-1 split).
Expectations were pretty high following Apple’s blockbuster quarter three months ago — the company reported the largest corporate quarterly earnings of all time. And it turns out that this quarter was Apple’s second-largest earnings of all time. In particular, services are now a $5 billion business, and Apple reported a gross margin of 40.8 compared to 39.9 for Q1 2015.
Apple is increasing its share buyback program with an authorization of $140 billion compared to $90 billion last year. Stockholders will also get a 11 percent higher dividend of $0.52 per share.
Fortune’s consensus among analysts was for Apple to report earnings of $2.21 per share on $56.85 billion in revenue, with both revenue and EPS exploding more than 24.7 percent and 33.1 percent, respectively; this is an insane growth prediction.
Apple’s own guidance from its last earnings release predicted between $52 billion and $55 billion in revenue, with gross margin between 38.5 percent and 39.5 percent. Apple’s guidance has been accurate for the past couple of years, except last quarter. Q1 2015 was the largest corporate quarterly earnings of all time, and even Apple couldn’t predict that.
“We are thrilled by the continued strength of iPhone, Mac and the App Store, which drove our best March quarter results ever,” Apple CEO Tim Cook wrote in the release. “We’re seeing a higher rate of people switching to iPhone than we’ve experienced in previous cycles, and we’re off to an exciting start to the June quarter with the launch of Apple Watch.”
This quarter, Apple sold 61.2 million iPhones, 12.6 million iPads and 4.6 million Macs in the quarter. Compared to Q2 2014, iPhone sales grew by 40 percent while iPad sales declined by 23 percent. Mac sales are up 10 percent. Read all the details about iPhone sales and Mac sales.
The iPhone’s average selling price is now $659 compared with $597 last year. This 10.4 percent increase in the average selling price (despite the unfavourable USD exchange rate) is probably the key growth driver for the company’s gross margin.
International revenue now represents 69 percent of the company’s total revenue. Q1 is always Apple’s biggest quarter because it’s during the holiday season in most of the world. But Chinese new year happens during Q2 and not Q1. That’s why revenue has been growing in China quarter-over-quarter, driving the company’s bottom line. Read more on China in our separate post.
Minutes after the release, shares are trading at $133.91 in after-hours trading, 0.95 percent above today’s closing price. Apple has been doing incredibly well on the stock market for the past three months.
Apple’s own guidance for Q3 2015 predicts between $46 billion and $48 billion in revenue with a gross margin between 38.5 and 39.5 percent. The company reported $37.4 billion in revenue last year.

Editor’s note: Nav Athwal is the CEO and founder of RealtyShares, an online marketplace for real estate investing.
Innovation, growth, technology, user experience, revenue and gross margin have become synonymous with how you define success for a tech startup. What is missing from this list is local, state, and federal regulation; terms that startups in the financial technology sector understand far too well as either barriers to or catalysts for growth and early success.
Regulation is one of the most significant hurdles for fintech companies to overcome. As stated so eloquently by Charles Moldow of Foundation Capital when referencing marketplace lending platforms, “it’s neither quick to start nor easy to scale a marketplace [lending] platform. And out of all of the barriers to entry, none are as significant and necessary to get right as state and federal regulations.”
Yet despite these regulatory hurdles and barriers, fintech pioneers like LendingClub, Motif Investing, Betterment and CircleUp are making it possible to get a loan in hours, invest your money seamlessly with low or no fees and access investments based on ideas and common sense themes rather than ambiguous stock quotes.
That is because these companies and others like them are pushing the envelope and navigating uncertain regulatory waters and legal gray areas to create disruptive technologies and marketplaces that change the way we invest and borrow money. But they understand far too well that navigating unsuccessfully can prove daunting and oftentimes fatal. In 2008, the SEC issued a cease-and-desist letter to P2P lender Prosper after deeming its activities to be in violation of the Securities Act of 1933. That same year, LendingClub went offline to comply with SEC regulation.
So while the SEC’s recent ruling to promulgate rules to implement Title IV of the JOBS Act was indeed cause for celebration in many ways, fintechs were slightly more temperate in their responses, knowing that they must continue to carefully navigate their way through regulatory issues. These regulations fall within both state and federal jurisdiction and include lending laws, securities regulation and broker dealer and investment adviser licensing requirements.
Lending laws. Companies like LendingClub, OnDeck and SoFi are disintermediating the traditional banking industry as we know it. And although a large part of their success is due to the nimbleness and efficiency with which they operate, an attempt to replace banks is not an easy one.
These companies must deal with state lending laws that regulate who they lend to, how much they can lend and the interest rates they can charge to borrowers. In order to mitigate some of this regulatory scrutiny, LendingClub has forged a partnership with WebBank, an FDIC-insured bank, to issue the loans.
Securities regulation. Platforms like AngelList and CircleUp have come a long way in terms of providing individuals with greater access to startups and small companies. However, due to securities laws and regulations that were created during and have changed little since the great depression, their services are restricted to high net worth or high-income investors (deemed accredited investors under the Securities Act of 1933) and fail to address a majority of the population. Alas their visions of greater access are only partially being realized.
Broker dealer and investment adviser licensing requirements. When platforms like Betterment, Motif Investing and Wealthfront decided they wanted to take on incumbents such as Charles Schwab and Fidelity, they realized doing so would require more than just a better product and would include navigating complex broker dealer and investment adviser licensing requirements.
These licensing requirements stem from the fact that these platforms provide investors access to investments that are classified as “securities” under the 1933 Act. Betterment, for example, is not only an SEC-registered investment adviser but its subsidiary Betterment Securities is also a broker-dealer regulated by FINRA and the SEC.
Accordingly, while startups like Uber or Airbnb have their own regulatory concerns, they tend to be at the municipal level and, therefore, easier to navigate, whereas fintech startups are regulated at every level making innovation that much more difficult.
But the same reasons that makes these fintech startups superior incumbents such as banks and traditional investment advisors – i.e. efficiency, technology and innovation – also make them well-suited to view regulation as an opportunity rather than an insurmountable challenge.
Founders of these companies realize that greater regulation also brings with it, as Charles Moldow has stated, greater barriers to entry and the need for flawless execution. And successful fintech startups have embraced this as a challenge and have ingrained it in their cultural DNA. It isn’t a surprise then that incumbents, out of fear of being disintermediated, are urging regulators for even stricter regulations in order to level the playing field.
And of course regulation isn’t all bad. If done right, it tends to bring with it legitimacy that can elevate fintech companies above competitors and can go a long way towards more sustainable growth.
LendingClub, for example, registered with the SEC at a time when they were second in line to their once larger competitor, Prosper. Understanding the importance of and need for the SEC’s stamp of approval, they worked with regulators and emerged in first place where they remain today as the market leader.
Another check in the pro-regulation column: the influx of an ecosystem of startups that help fintechs navigate the regulatory complexities. Companies like WealthForge, which targets broker/dealer services, and Epiphyte, which focuses on compliance surrounding bitcoin and cryptocurrency, are capitalizing on the business of regulation.
Although regulation is therefore not only necessary but at times beneficial, it’s important that regulators understand the changing nature of how we do business made possible through the Internet.
Consequently, it is time for regulators to take a step back and assess whether laws and regulations that pre-date the Internet (sometimes considerably) fit within the digital environment. And if the answer is no, it is their duty to find ways to expand their frameworks to include the demands of the digital investing revolution and the incredible innovation it enables across the financial services industry.

Postmates, a startup that allows users to order nearly anything in their city and have it delivered in an hour for a fee, is growing quickly. The company’s CEO, Bastian Lehmann, tweeted out a graph yesterday detailing how quickly the firm has scaled its delivery service.
Here’s the chart:

And here’s a version that TechCrunch’s own Bryce Durbin cooked up:

I decided to dig into the company’s financials a bit, so that we can better understand what that 1.5 million figure means. Let’s get started.
Postmates is a facilitator between couriers and consumers. You use its app to request an order, and then a courier accepts the delivery and executes it. The delivery denizens are not Postmates employees. Instead, they are independent contractors, a model that is currently in vogue with startups seeking to control labor costs as they scale.
Postmates collects 20 percent of the delivery fee that it charges. The other 80 percent, along with all additional tips, goes to the courier. That’s simple enough. Postmates also collects a 9 percent fee of the cost of goods. The 9 percent fee doesn’t have a cap, I confirmed with the company. The startup doesn’t mark up goods that it sells, so its cut of the delivery fee, and its own fee, are how Postmates collects the bulk of its revenue.
That’s all correct for 94 percent of Postmates orders, at current pace. The remaining 6 percent are monetized through the company’s Preferred Merchant Program, which it recently announced. The company partners with restaurants in that model and charges a lower delivery fee. I presume Postmates collects a cut from the restaurants that are part of the program.
So we have a decent understanding of how Postmates operates financially and how quickly it’s growing. All we need now is an average order size, and we can run the numbers on how much revenue Postmates is currently racking up.
Naturally, the company declined to share that number. A quick scan of Twitter led to a failed assortment of random guesses. We’ll have to run the spread.
Postmates declined to comment on its cashflow status, and its relationship with profitability. Most private companies decline to share data of that sort, so we won’t take it personally. However, the company did indicate that its gross margins are improving as its scale expands.
Returning to the original graph, Postmates most recently executed 500,000 deliveries in 10 weeks. That’s 50,000 per week or an average of 7,143 per day.
To calculate an estimate of Postmates’ revenue1, we select an average order size, average delivery fee, and crank. For example, if we guessed that the average Postmates order is $30, before other fees and the like, and that the average delivery fee charged is $8, we can do the following:
(7,143 x $30 x 0.09) + (7,143 x 8 x 0.20) = $30,715 in daily revenue, or an annual run rate of $11.2 million.2
You can ratchet the numbers around to get different results. Let’s presume a $20 average order size and keep our delivery estimate in place:
(7,143 x $20 x 0.09) + (7,143 x 8 x 0.20) = $24,286 in daily revenue, or an annual run rate of $8.86 million.
The run rates for $10 average orders and $40 average orders — again holding our delivery fee at an average of $8 — are $6.52 million and $13.55 million, respectively.
Given our lack of a firm average order estimate, our revenue results are annoyingly broad. However, given that range, we can cap, to an extent, Postmates’ current top line. Given that a $10 per-order average is likely quite low, we know that Postmates has a revenue run rate clearly north of $7 million. And as the average order size is likely not north of $40, the company is likely not generating revenue at a run rate of greater than $14 million.
So, it’s in there. What matters more to Postmates is that its revenue run rate is quickly expanding. Presuming that its average order size did not decline in the last 10 weeks, when the company saw quick growth, Postmates has doubled its run rate in the last 10 weeks from the pace it set in the preceding 20. Not bad.
Postmates has high gross margins on a per-order basis but has other costs, including software work and support. It isn’t clear that at its current revenue pace the firm is profitable, but if it can keep growing as it has, the idea doesn’t seem too implausible.
A potentially profitable startup? And I thought those were banned.

Editorâs note:Â Ezra Galston is a venture capitalist withÂ Chicago VenturesÂ and the former Director of Marketing for CardRunners Gaming. He writes the blogÂ BreakingVC.
As an investor in many digital marketplaces (Kapow Events,Â Spothero,Â Bloomnation,Â Shiftgig, amongÂ others, as well as an arts and crafts community,Â Blitsy)Â I have been eagerly awaiting Etsyâs S1 filing to get a deep look into the business.
The filing didnât disappoint. Etsy is a powerful business with extraordinary network effects. Its customers are extremely loyal, and its committed sellers are earning significant income. But there are legitimate concerns: it is the quintessential case study on the challenge of low margin platforms. Additionally, it faces uphill challenges â a slowing growth curve and unclear product pipeline. Most importantly, the IPO comes at an inflection point as Etsy looks to expand from its niche, artisanal focus to serving a much wider market.
Letâs dive in.
To truly understand Etsy, I felt it important to size it up against a few other marketplace businesses: Homeaway, Shutterstock and GrubHub.Â¹Â Although theyâre different, theyâre all participants in some aspect of the freelancer/sharing/independent economy. They all aggregate wildly fragmented markets. They also all make a similar claim: that their platforms ultimately expand the total addressable market and earnings for their merchants, despite acting as a fee taking middleman.
To start, here are some high level stats to see how they stack up against Etsy.Â Note,Â Homeaway does not report the Gross Values transacted across its platform as much of its revenue comes from subscriptions. I have attempted to back out those numbers based on several assumptions Â².

Here are my takeaways from this breakdown:
Growth is slowing.Â This isnât a huge surprise. It of course becomes incrementally harder to grow at the same Y/Y percentage as scale increases. But itâs especially concerning that their growth slowed in the face of a marketing spend thatÂ more than doubled in 2014Â from $18 million to $40 million (or, more accurately, increased by 40 percent on a percentage of revenue basis).
Seller services are paramount.Â Etsyâs gross margin has been increasing by a compounded 10 percent year/year for the past three years. Given that it hasÂ a consistent 3.5 percent commission and $0.20/listing fee, the obvious question is how thatâs possible? Answer: Ancillary services, add-ons, and products all targeted at itsÂ power sellers. Etsy breaks out itsÂ revenue into two categories: Marketplace Revenue (3.5% + $0.20/listing) and Seller Services (everything else).Â At the end of the day, to buy into Etsy, you need to believe that this product-focused revenue will grow significantly and drive itsÂ valuation.
Extraordinary network effects.Â One of my favorite metrics to analyze is marketing spend as a percentage of revenue. In this regard, Etsy is outright compelling. Historically it hasÂ spent 40-70 percent less on a percentage basis than their competitors, while realizing similar, if not greater, growth rates than other marketplaces. âNetwork effectsâ may be a buzz term,Â but Etsy is the paradigm. Eighty-seven percent of traffic is direct/organic while 78 percent of purchases are from repeat buyers.Â Thereâs a reason they can spend a whole lot less on marketing than the competition: Their powers sellers drive acquisition on their behalf.
Was 2014 an experiment?Â Etsy will need to credibly communicate to the market that itsÂ 2014 marketing efforts were experimental â being the first time itsÂ ever ramped marketing efforts so quickly and with a focus on building self-sustaining international markets. ItsÂ S1 suggests the increase was mostly buyer-side SEM acquisition in these foreign markets (and research suggests minimal traditional TV or radio advertising). But the results were disconcerting with CAC nearly doubling in 2014.
When investing in marketplaces, one of the defining factors I look for is evidence that the platform is generating sustainable and beneficial economics on both sides. For example, atÂ Zipments, many couriers are earningÂ nearly doubleÂ as independent workers on the platform than at their prior messenger agencies.
Another example: Bloomnation received the following e-mail from one of its florists:
I wanted to take a moment out of my day to thank you for allowing me to be part of Bloomnation. I spoke to you months ago. I was really hit hard and struggling in Jan-Feb. I was worried being a single mom and this was my 15th year in business. I work alone in order to take care of my son. I had no clue how internet sales worked. Your company has helped me get out of the red zone I was in and revitalize the energy of my shop, flow[ing] with orders. I really really appreciate your orders coming into my shop. In June I was able to put my son into school so I could focus on more business. You helped me fall back in love with my life and love of flowers. I feel so happy its like the feeling of how I first started back in 1999 when I was 19 in my garage on the beach.
The reason this supply-side effect matters so much is because of power law distribution: namely, power sellers will be the primary drivers of scale on your platform. While the long-tail of one-off sellers does provide product breadth and liquidity, power sellers will drive both volume and organic referrals to their own native product stores.
Consider how this has playedÂ out in the case of Etsy (note that Etsy defines a 2011 Active Seller/Customer to include all 2011 actives, including those acquired between 2005-2010, which self-selects for a large number of existing power users):
â

In its S1, Etsy offered a glimpse into its 2011 cohorts of both buyers and sellers. In this breakdown, we see that although only 32.3 percent of sellers who had sold an item in 2011 were still actively selling in 2014, those who remained on the platform had developed into serious power sellers â on average $13K per active seller from that cohort. And as power sellers become smarter and empowered by better tools, I expect their average earnings to continue increasing.Â This is one of the most fundamental signs of Etsyâs strength â the ability for its sellers to earn a living.
On the buyer side, we see an identical pattern of highly valuable repeat purchasing emerge:
â

Based on what Iâve seen among marketplaces, my best guess is that a typical cohort (2012-2014), will see year/year attrition of 80-85 percent or so, but the business isnât built on one-time buyers. The power buyers are coming back and purchasing 110 percent year over year.Â One ofÂ the fundamental questions the public markets need to ask is how many of these customers exist in the market and can Etsy find a way to reach them?
But overall, on a high level, Etsy has done an impressive job maximizing value for its sellers, especially as compared to its competitors.

âThe statistic to look at here is that in spite of active sellers increasing by 63 percent over the past two years, GMS per seller correspondingly increased by 32 percent in the same period. This is in contradistinction to a normal supply/demand curve â and is additional proof that Etsyâs buyers and sellers are among the most loyal and committed.
By comparison, Shutterstockâs active contributors, which also grew by 63 percent in the same period, only saw its earnings per seller increase by 19 percent. Impressive to be sure â but only half of Etsyâs growth.
As an aside, Homeaway would appear to have decelerating value to its property owners. But their business is heavily subscription based and free-to-post listings (implying lower quality properties) are whatâs dragging down the averages.

Nevertheless, Etsy and Shutterstock are also effectively free to create profiles and sell goods â whether high quality or not. Itâs something Iâd consider if I were an investor in Homeaway.
From a pure customer acquisition standpoint, none of these businesses break out CAC or LTV the way traditional e-commerce businesses do. That said, Iâve made some assumptions to get a rough model:

Above, Iâve broken down CAC for buyers OR sellers, assuming the entire marketing spend be allocated to either side. The biggest assumption Iâm making in this exercise is simply that Iâm defining ânew customersâ simply by taking the current periodâs cumulative buyers (or sellers) and subtracting the prior periodâs. Thatâs obviously a poor assumption because there was (a) attrition among actives and (b) reactivation of dormant accounts. But in assuming that (a) and (b) roughly cancel each other out, we can get a sense of Etsyâs marketing engine.
That said, in reality, Etsy has two customers â buyers and sellers. ItsÂ S1 notes âMarketing expenses increased $21.8 million, or 122.2 percent, to $39.7 million in 2014 compared to 2013, primarily as a result of an increase in search engine marketing from Google product listing adsâ (implying mostly buyer focused acquisition). So hereâs what it looks like if we assume 80 percent of expense on demand-side (buyers) and 20 percent supply-side (sellers).
â

Overall, CAC increased Q/Q across the board, both for buyers and sellers alike. While worrisome, itâs also expected at Etsyâs scale as thereâs a general law of diminishing incremental returns. But hereâs why that matters, and how Etsy stacks up versus GrubHub and Shutterstock:

The common thread across all these marketplaces is the continual move away from a dependency on pure transactional revenue. Hereâs how all four consider their revenue breakdown:
Etsy has six main revenue sources: 3.5 percent transaction commissions; $0.20 listing fees and seller services; promoted listings; direct checkout; shipping labels; andÂ point of sale paymentsÂ (like Square Reader).
Homeaway hasÂ three main revenue sources: subscription revenue from property owners for bundles of listings which comprises 77 percent of all revenues; 10 percent transaction commissions from pay-per-booking listings; and a variety of ancillary revenue sources such as national and local advertising, property management software solutions, insurance products, and tax preparation services.
GrubHub has two main revenue sources. ItâsÂ notoriously tight-lipped regarding itsÂ exact commission structure, but most estimates put its base commission to be relevant on listings about 10 percent and variable commission for preferred placement.
Shutterstock has four main revenue sources: subscription purchase packages; on-demand pricing where sellers receive 20-30 percent of the purchase price; license revenue from its video and music assets; and ancillary revenue from its online learning platform SkillFeed or cloud asset management software, WebDAM.
For each of these marketplaces (with the curious exception of Homeaway Â³) base transactional fees are of diminishing incremental importance â with ancillary products and services driving much of the platform margin growth. This likely explains why, for example, Grubhub has been so focused on entering the delivery game: a significant gross margin boost.
In Etsyâs case, the growth of non-transactional revenue is their strongest growth driver. So much so that they explicitly highlight the growth in their S1:
â

EtsyâsÂ Seller Services revenue has nearly doubled from 25 percent to 45 percentÂ of total revenues in the last two years and now includesÂ a full 450bps of Etsyâs gross sales volume. Vitally, the hyper growth in these new categories is offsetting aÂ tangible decreaseÂ in Etsyâs core marketplace gross margin â down 8Â percent over the past two years â most likely from discounting to new customers which has a contra-revenue (and thereby margin-contracting) effect.
These Seller Services are doubly important because Etsy also covers credit card processing fees on marketplace transactions, cutting itsÂ marketplace GM from 5.65 percent to an effective 3.5-4 percent. With that in mind, the question investors should be asking is how expensive are these supplementary services to build and operate and can they continue to grow nearly 100 percent year over year?
â

Although 2014 revenue grew by 57 percent, overall expenses grew by 68 percent. The silver lining is that if you remove marketing expense from the calculation, annual expenses grew only 51 percent.
Investors should be pushing Etsy to break out these expenses more clearly. Last yearÂ was oneÂ of learning on the marketing side for Etsy, and I would expect performance and spend to stabilize in 2015. If that assumption is correct and if the expenses requisite to support seller services continue to mature, Etsy will have a healthy balance sheet â although, at the expense of hyper growth.
Both GrubHub and Shutterstock go to great lengths to define the breadth of their space â $70 billion and $16 billion, respectively â with Shutterstock even commissioning a research report on the study. The home vacation rental market is massive, easily bursting into the hundred-plus-billion mark. But Etsy makes no mention of itsÂ market size â no comparison to arts and crafts supplies (a $30 billion annual segment). Itâs a curiosity that reflects Etsyâs possible Achilles heel â that the market simply isnât that big. It really feels intentionally omitted:
Etsy sellers offer goods in dozens of online retail categories, including jewelry, stationery, clothing, home goods, craft supplies and vintage items. Euromonitor, a consumer market research company, estimated that the global online retail market was $695 billion in 2013, up from $280 billion in 2008, representing a compound annual growth rate, or CAGR, of 19.9%. This growth is expected to continue, with the global online retail market becoming a significantly larger portion of the total retail market, reaching $1.5 trillion by 2018, implying a 16.6% CAGR from 2013.
With GrubHub at 2 percent market penetration and Shutterstock at (estimated) 2.5 percent if Etsy is nearing 10 percent of its addressable market, for example, that would certainly explain why itsÂ growth is slowing while GrubHub is accelerating in spite of identical gross sales.
While, in principle, the market for jewelry, home goods and craft goods is outright massive, Etsyâs strict guidelines around hand-crafted, artisanal products is certainly limiting. This concern that led to itsÂ major revision of seller guidelinesÂ 16 months ago as well as its launch ofÂ Etsy WholesaleÂ just 9 months ago. Even so, the success of outsourced vendors has yet to be validated â and casts real concern around their total addressable market.
Running through this market size exercise would make me extremely wary as an early-stage investor of the myriad niche or vertical specific marketplaces targeting smaller markets. Iâd go so far as to say that any space without a minimum of $5 billion in annual transaction volume is a non-starter.
If Etsy were to hit the public markets today at a $2 billion valuation (WSJ saysÂ $1.7 billion) hereâs how it would compare to its peers:

On both a revenue and EBITDA basis, Etsy believes it deserves a premium to more mature, slower growing marketplaces, which is fair. But unlike GrubHub, its growth is decelerating â quickly â even in spite of its focused efforts to leverage high-volume whole sellersÂ and point-of-sale.
The bet on Etsy is:
As Bill Gurley wisely communicated to Uber, one of the best ways for a company to avoid disruption is via cutting prices to the point where its effectively impossible to be undercut on price. This is Etsy. As compared to its peers, Etsy is the cheapest of transactional marketplaces for both buyers and sellers. But that comes at a cost: Etsy only works at scale â and its profitability is thereby dependent on non-transactional revenue.
Investors should be confident that Etsyâs loyal community will continue driving sales into the foreseeable future. The converse is that GrubHub or Shutterstockâs merchants are far more likely to abandon the platform for a lower-cost provider. Taking into account the size of the space and GrubHubâs growing margins, itâs no wonder investors are so bullish on the next generation of food-delivery apps â Postmates, Doordash and Sprig â with both a huge whitespace and opportunity to steal market share on price.
The majority of marketplace startups today are geo-focused, on-demand platforms (Uber is the paradigm). Though not a single one of these is yet to hit the public markets (or disclose detailed info), there are a couple of clear best-in-class benchmarks already emerging:
Maybe itâs the Chicago bias in me, but wow does GrubHub seem like a beast of a business. Yes, in my opinion, itâsÂ more susceptible to pricing disruption, but itsÂ accelerating growth, strong marketplace margins, mere 2 percent market penetration and heavy consumption frequency are really impressive. ItâsÂ deserving of itsÂ premium multiples, and Iâll be watching closely over the next 12 months.
Â 
Appendix
Â¹ Iâve seen some other articles try to compare Etsy to eBay, Alibaba, Wayfair and Zulily. I think all these comparisons are really flawed. Ebay is far too mature, founded nearly a decade before Etsy, not to mention that PayPal, not its marketplace, is its strongest product. Alibaba is far too horizontal to be an accurate comparison; and although Wayfair and Zulily connect buyers to sellers, theyâre both predominantly flash sales e-commerce businesses. I concede that the actual Wayfair platform is functionally a marketplace,Â but its growth driver, Joss & Main, does not conform to the same dynamics.
Â² HomeawayâsÂ pay-for-performance listings generate a 10 percent transaction fee. They have a variety of subscription bundles for power sellers, but we can assume that power sellers are savvy enough to generate noticeable discounts to that 10 percent fee on a subscription basis. I used a sliding scale, based on their subscription versus pay-for-performance listing to estimate their Gross Margin. Their Gross Margin was also positively affected by ancillary services (which they do self report). ShutterstockÂ does not formally note their GMV or Gross Margin but it can be backed out by assuming that their revenue represents gross transactional revenue, and subtracting the payouts to contributors noted in their cost of revenue description.Â Although that take is approximately 70 percent, their gross margins are ultimately slightly higher due to revenue from the SkillFeed platform and WebDAMs software.
Â³ I can only assume in order to mitigate questions of relevance versus Airbnbâs low friction signup/transactions. As well as to increase Gross Margins â I estimate from ~5% effective on a subscription basis closer to 10%. That said, their subscriber services are one of their strongest differentiators relative to Airbnb and it will be interesting to watch that battle play out.

What is worth $40 billion, and isn’t Uber? The union of NXP Semiconductors, and Freescale Semiconductor. The two companies announced a “definitive agreement” today that will see Freescale shareholders pick up 0.3521 NXP shares and $6.26 in cash for each of their current shares.
Freescale is known for its work in embedded chips, its website noting a focus on the Internet of Things, while NXP is best known for its automotive silicon work.
Seeing two large chip companies merge is hardly history, but at the very same time, we can get our mitts around the companies’ financial positions. This will be fun, I promise.
First up, Here’s Freescale’s last quarter: $1.10 billion in revenue, and $63 million in GAAP net profit. For reference, Freescale claims $273 million in adjusted EBITDA for the period. NXP is larger, recording $1.537 billion in revenue, and $149 million in GAAP net income in the quarter. And again, for reference, NXP claims $327 million in adjusted earnings for the period.
The joint release detailing the transaction crows about its financial impacts:
The transaction is expected to be accretive to NXP non-GAAP earnings and non-GAAP free cash flow. NXP anticipates achieving cost savings of $200 million in the first full year after closing the transaction, with a clear path to $500 million of annual cost synergies.
The release doesn’t detail if those savings figures are GAAP or not, but, regardless, they should allow the combined firm to increase its profit by a material amount.
The two firms had GAAP profits of $212 million in the last quarter. $500 million in annual savings, holding all other sums flat, would imply that the new operation may quickly expand its per-share quarterly profit.
Deals like this are fun because they grant us a different window into the current valuation game. The pair had just over $10 billion in revenue in the last calendar year, implying a roughly four-times valuation to sales ratio. That, and the two public firms have a history of profits that should push north as savings come online. And that’s worth $40 billion.
You cannot directly compare chip and software companies’ multiples effectively, given the difference in the gross margins of their core products. But we can see what $10 billion in revenue is worth when the two companies in question post modest revenue growth: NXP’s calendar 2014 revenue tally was up 17.3 percent on a year-over-year basis.

Apple is reporting its third-quarter earnings after the bell this afternoon. This will be the first quarter where the company’s new iPhones have been on sale — though only for a few weeks or so. Nevertheless, Apple’s earnings reports are always huge news for the company’s stock, which has basically gone back to where it started at the beginning of the year in recent weeks.
But still, the company has other products than the iPhone that it can talk about — particularly the Apple Watch. The earnings report should come out at around 1:30 PM Pacific, and TechCrunch’s Alex Wilhelm and Matthew Lynley will be dissecting the report and bringing it up-to-the-second information as it comes in.
All that and Apple is off about 30 basis points. So, nothing really happened. Go have a drink.
And that’s a wrap! Big things impacting Apple’s upcoming Quarter: foreign exchange, popularity in China, of course the new iPhones, and so on and so forth.
Thanks for joining!
Annnnd that is it.
New iPhones were available in China for just two days, according to Cook. Also, according to the exec, the 6S is the company’s most popular device right now.
In short, if you want Apple to do well, it’s time for the dollar to take it in the shorts.
Talking the foreign exchange impact again on Apple’s upcoming Q1 earnings, “it remains a significant headwind,” Maestri says. “On a net basis, foreign exchange will clearly be a sequential headwind.”
A small bit of color, for those following along in text. Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO, is a pretty commanding presence on the call. He is taking 100% zero static from analysts.
Cook points out that no one has asked about the iPad yet. Here’s the quick and dirty from him for iPads in China:
In China, the developer community is growing faster than any other country in the world, Cook says. “The ecosystem there is very, very strong. I was very impressed with the number of developers I met last week, and of course customers at stores are enthusiastically contagious.”
We are 46 minutes into this call, so we have about 15 minutes left. So far, no one has landed a real blow on Apple. Some growth concerns, but Apple is shouting forex! as a decent parry.
Here’s a thought: Apple is pivoting, slightly, to the enterprise, but mostly sells one-off products, like computers. It’s an inherently non-SaaS proposition, somewhat. We’ll dig more into this, but it’s an interesting anti-riff on what most companies that are working on selling products into the enterprise are doing, strategically. 
That’s an important thing to note, as Apple has that huge partnership with IBM. Apple is quietly building a huge enterprise business.
According to Cook, the iPhone 6 was the bestselling smartphone in mainland China last quarter. 
Apple’s not planning on building out an enterprise sales force, Cook says.
“I don’t envision Apple having a large enterprise sales force, we’ll continue adding some people, more on the engineering side. But I don’t envision having a large direct sales force.”
Put more simply, if currency rates had stayed the same compared to the year-ago quarter, Apple would have put even more points on the board.
You might not really care about global exchange rates, and I don’t blame you. But when a company’s financial performance is greatly predicated on sales outside of its home country, and rates change, it can materially impact sales growth. 
Back to Apple’s stock really quickly: it’s about flat right now, so nothing super exciting for investors on the call thus far.
We just spent a chunk of time discussing financial models, during which CEO Tim Cook dropped a bomb on the question. He essentially was like, no, and I disagree with your model, and you are an idiot.
Analyst: Just to follow up…
I wonder if they have speech trials for CFOs — that’s to say, if your voice is exciting, you are not hired.
These plans are being offered in some derivation in dozens of countries around the world, Cook says. “It seems we’re on the front end of a fairly major trend in the industry.”
Lynley, for the noobs, what does that mean in PlainSpeak?
Carriers are also offering upgrade plans, and in aggregate it’ll have a positive impact in replacement cycles, Cook says.
Also two other questions.
Gene Munster! It’s him! Isn’t he the guy who keeps saying that Apple is building a TV?
How do you think about the iPhone upgrade cycle compressing over the next few years, one analyst asks.
That was a long one because it was an important question, by the way.
According to Cook, the App Store is growing at over 20%. It has become a “sizable business,” according to CEO Tim Cook.
Analysts love to follow up. They are akin to PR people, but more annoying.
Who loves follow-ups
FOLLOW UP TIME
Apple just said that its enterprise business is now a $25 billion enterprise tip. Impressive.
“Apple TV is off to a great start, Apple Watch is just getting going, the App Store hit a new record again last quarter, and the growth seems to be really great there. I’m really happy with the early days of Apple Music and the people moving from the free trial to the music business. And finally the enterprise business is not to be underestimated, I doubt that many people knew we had a $25B enterprise business we quietly built in not too many years. But our penetration is low but we have significant actions going on to really deepen that.”
Please applaud how fast Lynley just typed that out.
“We believe iPhone will grow in Q1, we based that on what we’re seeing from a switcher point of view. We recorded the highest rate on record for Android switchers last quarter at 30%. We also look at the # of people that have upgraded that were in the install base prior to iPhone 6 and 6 Plus. That number is in the low 30 percentages, so we feel like we have a very open field in front of us. Our performance in emerging markets, although it is quite good… our market share is low and the LTE penetration in these markets is quite low,” Cook says.
“Also, if I zoom out and look at China, as I said before, we see an enormous change in China over the next several years. The latest study I’ve seen from McKinsey, if you look back 5 years China’s middle class had about 50m people, if you look ahead 5 years it’ll have 10 times that number. We’re reasonably well positioned in China, I’m sure we can do better but I think we’re doing fairly well there.”
Cook is currently discussing constant-currency headwinds, and how they impact earnings. Again, forex is to companies as weather is to economists.
“How do you get comfortable that Apple isn’t on the verge of ex-growth?”
Question and answer time! Who’s ready for analysts to ask 3 questions per session.
Ok we are on to questions! Strap in!
Apple declared a cash dividend of $0.52 per share, Maestri says.
While I enjoy the company of my colleague, he just misspelled ‘beer,’ which I find inexcusable.
I think we could all use some Red Bull.
Apple is now up a mere 0.06% in after-hours trading. Its shares are fading as its earnings call goes on. Perhaps investors could use a Red Bull.
Apple just extended its iPad ancillary revenue accounting period to three, from two years. I presume that that is due to the fact that consumers are buying iPads at a slower cadence than they do with iPhones. As such, you must adjust.
Breaking! Apple has opened a store in Belgium. In other news, Trappist monks are fans of Facetime.
According to the company, it has 1 million members in its Chinese developer community.
Surprise shoutout to Macs being deployed in IBM — with each device saving $270 thanks to reduced support costs and better residual value, according to Maestri. “This is a terrific example of the opportunity our devices offer to… create value in the enterprise world.”
How can you tell that Apple is Your Dad’s Tech Company? It’s currently discussing how well it is performing inside of IBM.
The CFO is currently touting iPad’s market share. It’s about 75% in the US, give or take. That is at once a lame defense, given iPad’s falling unit volume, and a slam at the larger US tablet market, given its falling unit volume.
According to the CFO, Apple saw its iPhone average selling price (ASP) rise in its most recent quarter. I presume that that boost is predicated on growing share of S iPhones, which cost more than regular-sized devices.
Current tally: Apple shares are up a 1.42%. That’s about half of its prior gains in after-hours trading. Investors are still digesting, it seems.
The CFO is now speaking. You can tell that it is the CFO as all charisma has fallen off of the call.
Okay, Apple is going over the September quarterly results in more detail. This is basically a recap of the financial statement — which we’ve covered below.
According to Cook, 40 million people are using Apple News. 70 partners are onboard.
Apple News launched in the UK and Australia with a slew of new partners, Cook says.
Not super clear what that means, but either way, the company is working to expand Apple Pay really aggressively.
Who uses American Express?
Apple is partnering with American Express to bring Apple Pay to “eligible customers in key global markets” as of today, Cook said. Apple Pay will be available to “eligible customers” in Australia and Canada this year.
Apple Pay, according to Cook, is seeing double-digit growth on a month-over-month basis. No baseline to compare to, of course, but even an Amazon’d stat can be slightly useful.
*insert Android joke here
61% of active iOS devices are running iOS 9 weeks after the release.
Cook just namechecked the iPad Pro, but didn’t disclose any sort of metrics. 
Again, no stats for the Apple TV — then again, it’s been available for about a split-second.
“We think apps represent the future of TV,” Cook says.
Apple now has 25 stores in China. It expects to reach its 40 by the middle of next year. 
There are now 13,000 apps for the Apple Watch, according to CEO Tim Cook.
So basically a really strong showing for the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus, though he hasn’t given out any kind of new stats just yet. Then again, Apple usually doesn’t break out specific iPhone version sales.
According to Cook, the 5.7 million Macs that it sold was an all-time records. That sound you hear is Lenovo et al crying into their porridge. 
Demand for new iPhones exceeded supply exiting the quarter, Cook said, though the supply chain is doing a decent job of keeping up.
Cook just said ‘privacy.’ — Drink.
Apple completed 15 acquisitions, Cook says.
“We’re in the very early innings of this promising new part of our business,” Cook says on the Apple Watch — no stats or anything like that yet.
Cook now crowing about having 100 billion total downloads on its App Store to date. Hot take: That’s more than what Windows 10 has accreted.
According to Cook, that was the largest aggregate dollar increase in its revenue ever.
Apple reported revenue of $234B for its fiscal 2015 year, an increase of 28% over 2014, Tim Cook says.
Tim Cook is going to kick things off. He’s the uncle you wished that you had. Since he flies private. 
Here we go! The call is starting for the 4Q earnings.
I am firing up a new device, as Apple wants me to use iTunes to listen to its call on my Surface Book. I currently have enough screens up to get a tan.
Here’s the quick roundup:
EPS: $1.96
Revenue: $51.5B
iPhone sales: 48.05M
iPad sales: 9.9M
Mac sales: 5.7M
T-minus 8 minutes until the earnings call. We’ll be listening in and updating as the information comes in.

And here’s the company’s revenue performance

Here’s how the company’s EPS reports look from recent quarters.
Ok! That is the rough take. The earnings call kicks off in 12 minutes. If you want to get a beer, now is the time. Or two. Your humble servant is about to raid the TechCrunch fridge. I shall return.
According to the company, Apple has “completed over $143 billion of [its] $200 billion capital return program.” — Read differently, expect Apple to announce either a new program, or an extension of its current. Bored cash makes no fans.
So if you sold your Apple shares, to buy Twitter shares ahead of earnings, beers are on TechCrunch.
In other news, Twitter shares are still off nearly 11%. That’s bad. But, Twitter’ decline in value is worth a minor fraction of Apple’s gain, given the extreme difference in their aggregate market caps.
For more on Apple’s Chinese performance, our own Lucas Matney has you more than covered: http://techcrunch.com/2015/10/27/apple-revenues-in-china-shoot-up-99-in-q4/
And that is why we track YoY revenue growth, and not sequential quarter revenue gyrations with seasonal companies!
Greater China revenue was down compared to the last quarter: $12.5 billion this quarter, compared to $13.2 billion in 3Q. This can be sort of apples/oranges, and revenue has about doubled year-over-year (it was $6.3 billion in Q4 2014).
That is factually accurate. TechCrunch has pinged a few sources, and they can confirm — albeit off the record — that the amount of cash that Apple has transcends this mortal coil.
This company has so much cash it’s unreal.
I feel poor.
Apple is, by our back-of-the-envelope math, now worth just over $670 billion. Up from around $653 billion at the end of regular trading.
You don’t say!
A quote to keep things fun. This is from Tim Cook: “Fiscal 2015 was Apple’s most successful year ever.”
Apple returned $17 billion in share repurchases and dividends as part of their $200 billion capital return program.
So, Apple is up around 1/4th of an Uber in after-hours trading.
Shares of Apple are up just under 2% in after-hours trading. If that sounds surprising, given the company’s massive quarter, keep in mind that 2% of Apple is worth more than $12 billion.
That’s a lot of dollars.
Here’s the guidance for the huge upcoming holiday quarter: $75.5 billion to $77.5 billion in revenue, with gross margin coming in between 39% and 40%.
Apple’s aggregate cash supply is now north of $205 billion. That is more money, I can confirm, than I currently own.
Gross margin was 39.9 percent, compared to 38 percent in the year-ago quarter, according to the company.
Here’s a number that should make you weep: In its most recent quarter, Apple had operating cash flow of $13.5 billion. Oh, and its gross margin improved in the period to 39.9%. Like Apple or not, it’s a dope shop all around from a number perspective.
The iPhone was, as usual, the biggest revenue driver by far. $32.2 billion of the company’s earnings came from sales.
9.9 million iPads, 5.7 million Mac units.
Keep in mind that this is Apple’s final fiscal quarter of its year, so we have full-year results. According to the phone company, it’s revenue for the fiscal year of $234 billion was up 28 percent, compared to the prior year. That’s ok.
Apple sold 48.05 million iPhones.
According to first reports, the company managed to earn $1.96 per share, off revenue of $51.5 billion in revenue. That’s better than expectations.
Shares of Apple are up 2.5%
First take is that Apple beat on both revenue, and profit!
The results are out!
I have to ask, Matthew: Are you excited?
The earnings report should be out any minute now.
China’s a big question for Apple, for sure. There are also some questions around slowing growth, and China is a huge market for Apple.
Also keep in mind that the new iPhone has only been for sale for so long. That could deprecate trailing sales, while not implying that holiday quarter shipments would be light.
Tablets maybe — there are questions over whether the tablet market has actually been saturated. Then again, Apple gave the iPad a whole section to itself at the last iPhone event.
We’ll have a keen eye on Chinese sales figures, and, of course, if the iPad can stop its unit volume declines. Tablets for now? Tablets forever? Tablets maybe.
Apple’s stock hasn’t done quite so well in recent weeks, and on the year it’s given up most of its gains from earlier in the year.
In the mean time, here’s what analysts are expecting: $1.88 in earnings per share, an revenue of around $51 billion.
Alex here. I can confirm that Matthew is still a handsome devil.
Good afternoon! The earnings report should be out shortly.

After payments processor First Data priced its initial public offering at $16 per share last night, below the expected range of $18-$20, all eyes were on the company to see how the year’s biggest IPO — raising $2.56 billion — would perform in its debut. Ultimately, there were no fireworks. Trading under the FDC ticker on the New York Stock Exchange, First Data’s stock opened this morning at $16.39, up 2.43% and coming in not with a bang, but a whimper.
And at the time of writing, FDC’s is not looking great. Today the stock closed below its IPO price, at 15.83 per share.
The $2.6 billion in net proceeds that First Data picked up from its IPO is the biggest of the year. The company’s valuation of $14 billion, however, is well below the $29 billion that KKR paid in 2007 when it bought out First Data and took the company private after its first outing in the public markets.
While First Data did not give a reason for its IPO pricing decision, some believe it was because of the iffy market for IPOs right now. Others cite the fact that the company is carrying a lot of debt, currently to the tune of $21.16 billion, with a lot of that attributable to that buyout in 2007. The IPO proceeds will be used to pay some of that down.
First Data is unprofitable, in part because of the interest it’s paying on that debt. In the first half of 2015, the company reported a net loss of $138 million.
There are also some external factors that may also impact how well First Data may do. For starters, Square also filed for an IPO just last night.
Square may be working with gross margins of just 29 percent and also has a net loss, in its case, $78 million for the first half of this year. But it’s smaller and more nimble and in these heady days of tech, size may prove to be less of success factor than innovation and simply being able to move faster than financial giants to respond to changing market conditions. Or so some thinking goes, at least.
And First Data, indeed, is something of a payments giant. The company posted revenues of $5.56 billion for the first half of the year; is present in some 6 million businesses and 4,000 financial institutions across 118 countries. Its 23,000 “owner-associates” process over 2,300 transactions per second and $1.9 trillion annually, the company says.
And while it’s huge, First Data has been trying to “make up” for that size by buying many smaller and more nimble startups to try to match the Squares of the world. Most recently, the company bought Spree Commerce as a move into open source payments technology.
First Data’s IPO was run by Citigroup Inc., Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch and KKR.
Below is an interview from the NYSE floor with Katie and First Data’s President, Guy Chiarello.

Bezar, the bizarre bazaar imagined by Fab.com cofounder Bradford Shellhammer, is today introducing a more traditional marketplace for design brands to sell their wares called Storefronts.
Bezar launched in March 2015 with a very clear system. Four designers from four separate categories (art, accessories, house, and jewelry) would be featured each day on the front page of Bezar, with prices ranging between $50 and $100 (and sometimes far exceeding that). Just like a real-life bazaar, the products only had a shelf life of 24 hours to three days.
“Launching a marketplace has been the plan all along,” said Shellhammer. “After systematically speaking with designers, it became clear that there is a wide range of designers who are too big to be considered hobbyists and too small to manufacture their products for thousands of stores. Plus, they are afraid of being ripped off by big chains.”
To solve this, the company has launched storefronts, where highly curated (by Shellhammer) design brands will have their own page on Bezar to feature their line.
With Storefronts, brands set their own pricing and Bezar takes a relatively high percentage of sales, in exchange for the digital retail space, customer service, along with shipping and part of the fulfillment process (all handled by Bezar).
This differs from Bezar’s pop-up shops (otherwise known as flash sales), where Bezar buys up inventory at wholesale and sells it at a markup.
This all seems pretty cut and dry, but Bezar’s business model gets truly interesting when it comes to art. Whether in a pop-up shop or in a storefront, Bezar licenses art and handles all printing, framing, shipping, fulfillment, etc. for this product category, paying out royalties to the artist for each sold piece.
Shellhammer says about 30 percent of revenue comes from the art category.
“We’re very strict with gross margins,” said Shellhammer. “When you blend monthly sales together, from each product category, we’ve never fallen below 50 percent gross margins, sometimes getting north of 60 percent on good months.”
Since launch, Bezar has worked with about 750 design brands on pop-up shops, with 100 of them launching today with their own storefronts.
“I hand-picked and invited each of them,” said Shellhammer. “We decided based on a number of factors, including what sold the best, which products I love the most, and who was easiest to work with.”
The products launching today on Storefronts are mostly brand new lines, and Shellhammer explains that it gives the shopper with intent a reason to like Bezar.
“If you’re like me, and you love beautiful objects and you’ll buy something shiny if it’s danged before your eyes, Bezar pop-up shops are perfect for you,” said Shellhammer. “But we also want to capture the user who is shopping with intent, for something specific.”
Shellhammer expects the number of storefronts to rapidly increase, but the design wunderkind says that he’s sticking to the pop-up shop model as the heart and soul of Bezar.

Today following the bell, Intel reported its third-quarter financial performance, including revenue of $14.5 billion and earnings per share of $0.64. Following its earnings beat, shares in the chip giant initially rose.
Analysts had expected Intel to report a $0.59 per-share profit, off revenue of $14.2 billion. Those expectations represented a 10.6 percent decline and a 2.3 percent fall, respectively.
To round out the raw numbers, Intel reported third-quarter net income of $3.1 billion and gross margin of 63 percent. The firm spent $1.1 billion on dividends during a three-month period, and repurchased 36 million of its own shares at an expense of $1.0 billion.
Breakdown
Numbers are god but also bullshit. So let’s take this apart slightly:
Intel concluded the period with cash, equivalents, and short-term investments of more than $14 billion, up from the year-ago period, and the sequentially preceding quarter. So that’s nice.
The PC Market
Please make the following sound with your face: Womp, womp. Here’s the breakdown via Intel’s release:

That’s not so good. Keep in mind that the PC market is large, with many players. The above means that other OEMs, and participants like Microsoft, likely aren’t have a ball.
Guidance
Call it outlook if you will, but Intel expects revenue of $14.8 billion in the holiday quarter. Presumably a chunk of that will come from the traditionally strong PC sales cycle that takes place around Christmas.
Intel expects its gross margin to slip 100 basis points to a round figure of 62 percent. Those figures imply profitability not wildly different from the now-past quarter.
Intel remains a company in transition, looking to new revenue streams to supplement and replace falling PC incomes; the decline of its PC dollars is not Intel’s fault, per se, but is instead more of a reflection on the stale, and slipping PC market itself.
Shares of Intel are now mostly flat in after-hours trading.

Parsa Saljoughian is currently an MBA Candidate at the Stanford Graduate School of Business. Previously, he spent 3 years at Institutional Venture Partners, a late-stage venture capital firm in Menlo Park. 
We are currently witnessing a shift in business models, as many consumer tech companies move from transactional models in favor of subscription-based ones. YouTube is launching an ad-free, subscription-based service. Apple recently launched a streaming music service for $10/month. Microsoft just bundled its popular consumer products into a $199/month offering as cloud services have become a critical part of the company’s turnaround strategy.
Many of our other favorite consumer services, such as Netflix, Spotify, Slack and Dropbox, operate on a subscription-based model — and have experienced stellar growth. Even upstarts like Dollar Shave Club and Blue Apron Labs have applied this model to delivering physical goods and have raised capital at massive valuations.
If you operate under a subscription model, how do you go about measuring success? Below is an overview of the key inputs and outputs you should track closely.
 
This metric is the average subscription revenue generated per user each month. The easiest way to calculate this metric is to take the revenue generated from subscriptions and divide it by the average number of subscribers over that period.
 
A major driver of lifetime value in a subscription-based model is monthly subscriber churn. It cannot be overstated how important churn is as a metric. After 36 months, a company with 1 percent monthly churn will retain roughly 70 percent of its customer base. On the flip side, a company with a 6 percent monthly churn will only retain 11percent of its customer base.
It is difficult (and expensive) to build a large subscriber base if your customers are regularly leaving. Try to create competitive moats that differentiate your service from others. By doing this, you will have a stronger value proposition and customers will likely stick around longer.
According to research analysts, Netflix has dropped its monthly churn to 3 percent, down from record-high churn rates of 5-6 percent several years ago. The reason churn has dropped is likely because of the company’s investment in an improved content portfolio and steady slate of originals.

 
A healthy monthly churn rate for a high-quality consumer Internet business is between 2-4 percent. If you are above this range, talk to your customers and figure out what they like/dislike about your service. Ask outgoing customers to explain why they cancelled. There is a difference between customers who cancel because they don’t like your service, because they can’t afford it and because their credit cards expired.
 
Gross margin measures the percentage of revenue the company retains after accounting for all the direct costs associated with making a product or providing a service. This is important because it directly impacts the profitability of your business. Many SaaS businesses have high gross margins of 70-80 percent, which leads to a higher LTV and gives more flexibility on how much can be spent on customer acquisition. Companies like Netflix and Spotify, with significant content costs, have lower gross margins and thus less flexibility. 
 
Lifetime value is simply the dollar value of a customer relationship. It is the future profit you expect to earn from a customer throughout his or her relationship with the business. Defining lifetime value is incredibly important because it represents the upper limit on how much you can spend to acquire new customers. As in our example above, monthly churn significantly impacts the lifetime value of our users. Assuming a $9.99 monthly price-point and 50 percent gross margins, with 6 percent monthly churn we have an $83 lifetime value and with 1 percent churn we have a $500 lifetime value. This is a massive difference.

Companies often mistakenly calculate lifetime value without factoring in gross margin. By doing so, you would be overstating your lifetime value and potentially overspending to acquire customers. If you are calculating it this way to impress investors, well, they won’t be fooled!
 
CAC is the cost associated with convincing a customer to buy your product or service. There are many different ways to calculate CAC, but the recommended method is to take all your sales and marketing expenses and divide it by the total gross number of subscribers added in the specific period you are measuring. If you have different revenue lines, such as advertising, make sure to isolate and include only the costs related to driving new subscription revenue. If you have costs related to retention of existing accounts, you can exclude them for this calculation.
Most consumer businesses will have a majority of customer acquisition spend come from paid marketing. And there are many different online acquisition channels: Google, Facebook, Twitter, Affiliate, SEO, SEM, Email, Blog, PR, Referral, Free tiers (if you have a freemium model), etc. As you run your business, track lifetime value and CAC across every channel.
Test and see which channels are more viable than others. Certain channels will be more expensive, but may source high-quality customers. Others will be cheaper, but may source low-quality customers. Don’t measure LTV and CAC in isolation, but together. The limit on how much you should be spending on CAC is your customer lifetime value. If you are spending more than what your customers are worth, then you are running an unprofitable business.
Once users reach your website, your CAC will be directly tied to your ability to convince them to purchase a subscription. Investing in funnel design and A/B testing is critical, as simple tweaks can increase your conversion rates (and decrease acquisition costs) significantly. Here are some questions to think about that may impact your conversion rate:
One of the major outputs you should track closely is time to payback, which is the number of months it takes to recover your upfront acquisition costs. Investors love this number because it is an overall measure of the efficiency of your subscription business.
A general guideline is to keep payback under 12 months. In the example below, we can see the cumulative cash flow and payback for an average user. We assume it costs $30 initially to acquire an average user. In each month (including month 1), users contribute cash flow to offset these costs. The chart shows that an average user becomes profitable in month 7.​

The longer the payback time, the more capital will be required to grow your business. Imagine if it took 24 months to receive payback on an average subscriber. If you invested $10 million into acquiring a bunch of these users, you would have to wait 24 months before you received the $10 million back (assuming they paid monthly), and even longer to receive any potential profits. During these 24 months you may have other initiatives that also require investment, meaning you would likely need to raise more capital or push out some of your other growth plans.
 
Another major output you should focus on closely is subscriber ROI or LTV / CAC ratio. The best subscription businesses have a ratio that is above 3.0x. This means that if you invest $10 million, you would eventually receive $30 million of cash back. If this ratio is less than 1.0x, this means you are spending more to acquire customers than they are worth (Hint: You won’t be in business long…). It is also important to review this ratio along with payback time. There is a difference between a 3.0x ROI with payback of 7 months and 24 months.
Let’s review a few examples that put together all we have learned. We’ll take our four key variables (ARPU, Monthly Churn, Gross Margin Percent and CAC) and use them to understand how profitable our subscribers are.

Base Case. Our subscriber ROI is 3.3x with payback of 7 months. This is attractive! Within 7 months we recover our $30 investment and more than triple that investment during the user’s lifetime. Now let’s see what happens if we tweak each of the main variables.
Increase Churn. We increase churn from 5 percent to 8 percent, which significantly decreases lifetime value from $100 to $62. This stretches out our payback by one month and decreases our subscriber ROI to 2.1x.
Decrease Gross Margin. We decrease gross margin from 50 percent to 30 percent, which drops our lifetime value from $100 to $60 and doubles our payback time to 14 months. Subscriber ROI drops by almost half, to 2.0x.
Increase CAC. We increase CAC from $30 to $50, which doubles our payback time to 14 months and decreases subscriber ROI to 2.0x. While LTV in this example is higher than in the previous example, our subscriber ROI is the same in both cases. This is because our acquisition costs have also increased significantly.

Apple has just released its fiscal Q1 2015 earnings, reporting $74.6 billion in revenue, $18 billion in net profit representing $3.06 per share. This is the largest corporate quarterly earnings of all time, above Gazprom, Royal Dutch Shell and ExxonMobil. Compared to the year-ago quarter, it corresponds to a growth of 29.5 percent in revenue, and 47.8 percent in EPS (adjusted for the 7-for-1 split).
Fortune’s consensus among analysts was for Apple to report earnings of $2.68 per share on $68.71 billion in revenue, with both revenue and EPS exploding more than 19.3 percent and 29.3 percent respectively — this is an insane growth prediction. In particular, analysts expected iPhone sales to drive the company’s performance. But these expectations were nowhere near today’s crazy quarterly earnings.
The iPhone is this quarter’s clear winner. Tim Cook reported during the earnings call that this quarter represented the highest number of new iPhone users and the highest switch rate from an Android phone to an iPhone.
Apple’s own guidance from its last earnings release predicted between $63.5 billion and $66.5 billion billion in revenue, with gross margin between 37.5 percent and 38.5 percent percent. Apple’s guidance has been accurate for the past year and a half, with the upper end of the forecast very close to what it actually reported. But this time, Apple was too conservative and easily beat its own guidance.
“We’d like to thank our customers for an incredible quarter, which saw demand for Apple products soar to an all-time high,” Apple CEO Tim Cook wrote in the release. “Our revenue grew 30 percent over last year to $74.6 billion, and the execution by our teams to achieve these results was simply phenomenal.”
This quarter, Apple sold 74.5 million iPhones, 21.4 million iPads and 5.5 million Macs in the quarter. Compared to Q1 2014, iPhone sales grew by 46 percent while iPad sales declined by 17.7 percent. Read all the details about iPhone sales and Mac sales.
Many analysts expected Apple to announce that the company sold more iPhones in China than in the U.S. for the first time ever. While the company didn’t break out iPhone sales by region, international sales represented 65 percent of Apple’s revenue, with China representing $16.1 billion in revenue. Read more about sales in China.
Apple's CFO told us the company did not sell more iPhones in China than the U.S. #AAPL
Minutes after the release, shares are trading at $114.48 in after-hours trading, 4.89 percent above today’s closing price.
Apple’s own guidance for Q2 2015 predicts between $52 billion and $55 billion in revenue with a gross margin between 38.5 and 39.5 percent. The company reported $45.6 billion in revenue last year. Don’t expect the Apple Watch to boost the company’s next earnings as Tim Cook just announced that it would be released in April.

Editor’s Note: Boris Wertz is the founder of version one ventures, and has invested in over 50 early-stage consumer and enterprise companies, including Chloe & Isabel, Frank & Oak, Julep, and Indochino. Follow him on his blog and on Twitter @bwertz.
Recent weeks have brought some major shakeups to the e-commerce world as Sophia Amoruso stepped down as CEO of Nasty Gal and Eric Koger stepped down as CEO of ModCloth.
While some may wonder if such personnel changes signal the fall of vertically integrated retail, I believe the industry is entering a new phase where successful players will look and behave more like retailers and less like tech startups.
Two years ago, I wrote that vertically integrated retailers represented the next wave of e-commerce, citing examples like Warby Parker, Bonobos, Frank & Oak, Julep, and yes, Nasty Gal and ModCloth.
These web-only brands vertically integrate the retail value chain, taking ownership of the design, curation, manufacturing, and sales. By going straight to the consumer and typically foregoing the high costs associated with brick and mortar, vertically integrated (or v-commerce) retailers can offer high-quality products, such as eyeglasses or clothing, at significantly lower prices.
Perhaps even more importantly, these start-ups are able to carve out a niche with unique offerings that stand out among mass-market goods. As the saying goes, “If it has a UPC code, Amazon will beat you” (via Chris Dixon). By owning the design and manufacturing, v-commerce retailers don’t have to compete head-to-head with Amazon. In addition, they can offer their customers a more rewarding experience based on small-batch, artisanal philosophies.
For all the promise that vertically integrated commerce offers, these retailers have struggled to scale beyond $100 million in revenue. TechCrunch reported that ModCloth saw little to no growth in 2014, and reduced its engineering team to just over a half-dozen.
It is unfair to generalize what is happening with a diverse group of retailers by assuming that scaling problems with one company apply across the board. However, it is true that with any niche or long tail marketing, you can connect with your target customer segment quickly and efficiently, but it is much harder to break into the mass market. To put it another way: it’s easier to scale with a blockbuster film than a collection of low-volume art films.
For this reason, we’ve seen many examples of impressive early growth followed by relative stagnation among v-commerce start-ups.
Additionally, since these companies haven’t gotten to scale yet, they aren’t enjoying the deepest price breaks in the supply chain and the best gross margins. As a result, more v-commerce start-ups are forced to change their initial business model and focus on profitability over revenue growth. Breaking even is the new goal for many of these start-ups.
In a company announcement about his departure as ModCloth CEO, Koger wrote:
“We always knew the time would come when ModCloth would need the leadership of an experienced retail executive to take our well-loved brand into the future, expand our distribution, and lead the continued evolution of the customer experience.”
One important lesson we have learned over the past years is that vertically integrated retailers are a lot closer to traditional retailers than we once thought. While these companies are often portrayed and positioned as tech start-ups disrupting retail, they still need to follow the retail playbook and sweat the small stuff in order to succeed.
We should expect more v-commerce companies to change up their teams in the near future in order to bring in seasoned executives with deep retail experience.
A growing number of v-commerce companies are refocusing their acquisition and growth strategies on offline versus online. Warby Parker, Birchbox, Bonobos, Frank & Oak, Indochino, and Harry’s have all recently opened some kind of physical space.
Warby Parker’s co-Chief Executive Neil Blumenthal told the Los Angeles Times, “We can create really special experiences online, but there’s nothing quite like walking into a physical space, a world we’ve created. … To some extent these stores can be considered a form of marketing and customer acquisition.”
Offline channels let shoppers try things on, see the quality first-hand, and interact with a brand on a deeper level. Pop ups and stores tend to generate more word-of-mouth than online since shoppers are immersed in a fuller experience.
By 2016, men’s retailer Bonobos will have approximately 40 “Guideshops” nationally. As a great example of showrooming trends moving offline to online, Bonobos’ physical locations will bolster its online business: customers can go to a location, try on clothes first-hand, and then order them to be shipped a few days later.
The takeaway message should not be that e-commerce is moving offline. Vertically integrated companies will continue to rely on online as the most cost-effective channel for reaching their markets. However, we are learning that v-commerce is harder to scale and execute than we once thought.
As v-commerce matures, the lines between tech start-up and retailer will blur. These entrepreneurs will innovate across multiple channels, while borrowing from the traditional retail playbook, to improve the customer experience.

Today after the bell, Microsoft reported the financial performance of the second quarter of its fiscal 2015, including revenue of $26.47 billion and earnings per share of $0.71. The financial markets had expected the company to earn $0.71 per share on revenue of $26.33 billion.
Down less 1 percent in regular trading, Microsoft is down 2 percent after hours.
The company’s revenue’s were up 8 percent compared to the year ago period, and its earnings per share were down 7 cents, or around 9 percent. For the fiscal period, the company reported operating income of $7.8 billion, and gross margin of $16.3 billion. The company ended the quarter with $90.25 billion in cash and equivalents. By my rough math, that makes Microsoft still frakking rich.
The company’s Devices and Consumer division reported revenue of $12.9 billion, up 8 percent on a year-over-year basis. The company’s other core element, its Commercial revenue ticked up 5 percent to $13.3 billion compared to last year’s equivalent financial period.
Hardware
Microsoft sold 10.5 million Lumia phones in the quarter, bringing in revenue of $2.3 billion. The company sold $1.1 billion worth of Surface hardware. Those figures compare to the sequentially preceding quarter’s tally of 9.3 million Lumia devices sold, $2.6 billion in phone revenue, and $908 million in Surface revenue.
The company sold 6.6 million Xbox consoles during the holiday quarter. The company did not break out the mix of Xbox 360 and Xbox One consoles, however.
The Surface and Lumia numbers are strong, all time highs.
The Cloud
According to Microsoft, its commercial cloud revenue grew 114 percent compared to the year-ago period. In the sequentially preceding quarter, the company noted a 128 percent rise. It ended the current quarter on a $5.5 billion run rate. Update: I accidentally put a FQ4 2014 figure into this for the company’s past commercial cloud run rate, calling it a FQ1 2015 statistic. I have removed the number, and am horribly embarrassed. 
On the consumer side, Office 365 sold to the masses picked up 2.2 million subscribers to end the quarter at 9.2 million. The company ended its previous with 7 million subscribers for consumer Office 365 — so, Microsoft grew that figure by 31 percent in a quarter.
Windows
Here’s how Windows performed across its three main revenue silos:
Windows OEM Pro revenue declined 13%; revenue was impacted by the business PC market and Pro mix returning to pre-Windows XP end of support levels and by new lower-priced licenses for devices sold to academic customers
Windows OEM non-Pro revenue declined 13%, with license growth from opening price point devices
Windows volume licensing revenue increased by 3%, with annuity revenue growth partially offset by declining transactional revenue
All told, it was a solid quarter for the company, but not a corker when it came to raw financial performance. Microsoft has been on something of a product roll lately, with its Windows 10 operating system picking up decent early reviews, and its Surface Hub and HoloLens devices stoking mass-market interest. Today earnings underscore that uptick in corporate momentum.
Cloud and devices each did well. Windows had a predictably rough quarter. The metamorphosis of Redmond continues.

Egnyte, a provider of enterprise file management products, is shifting its strategy to place itself between a company’s datacenter and its cloud storage provider. Previously, the company tried to be a cloud storage solution that worked with a firm’s current on-premises file system. Now, Egnyte wants to become the intelligence layer between any company’s current storage system and their cloud provider of choice.
The move was presaged by Egnyte’s decision to shift its storage of new client data to Google’s cloud. Google Ventures is an investor in the company.
Given the shift at company — for a detailed product breakdown of what Egnyte has planned, TechCrunch’s Ron Miller has the full score — I spoke to its CEO Vineet Jain about the health of Egnyte, and its future financial performance.
The company appears to be in modestly rude health. It expects its gross margin to expand from 68 percent in 2014, to 74 percent in 2015. Egnyte also expects to reach cash-flow breakeven this year, and profitability in the first quarter of 2016. That growth in gross margin is not surprising, given that the firm is focusing less on the raw storage of data, and more on helping IT departments learn about the information use of their charges, shifting bits between servers and cloud providers for the most efficient storage solution.
Previously, Egnyte noted that it was on track for $100 million in 2015 revenue, well within the current IPO window in terms of top line.
As a player in the cloud storage and enterprise productivity space, Egnyte is part of the same crew as Box, which is currently shoving forward with an initial public offering of its shares. Box has larger revenues than Egnyte, but also loses far more cash — if Egnyte will reach parity between its outgoings and comings inside of the current  year, it will do so before Box; Box, however, has around $240 million in annual recurring revenue, making it a larger firm in total.
So Egnyte is growing, has a new product focus, and is approaching profitability. That sounds like a candidate for an IPO inside of the next six quarters, provided that corporate funding source Google doesn’t snap up the company. Egnyte is working to build its business by landing enterprise-scale customers, a group that Google itself wants to convert to its storage, compute and productivity tools. Egnyte could be a leg up in that market.
For now, however, it seems that the firm is content to work to differentiate itself from the raw cloud storage market, where margins have gone from slim to none to worse. If you can make a dollar selling a gigabyte of cloud storage, points to you. Egnyte, which has no free option, has long made that point, and is living up to its previous rhetoric of saying that being freemium in cloud storage is a losing proposition.
As always, viva la platform wars.

Dropbox boasts a valuation in the $10 billion range. Last February the company hired a new CFO, which for many startups is a signal that their IPO moment is coming sooner rather than later. Nobody knows for sure of course, and Dropbox isn’t talking, but if the company does decide to move forward with a flotation, it could face several challenges in spite of its strong market presence.
For starters, last week, tech stocks got dragged to the woodshed by Wall Street in a market that has turned ever more skeptical about growth over profits. Against this backdrop, any tech company thinking about an IPO, may want to hunker down until the bankers are in a better mood.
Should that happen, Dropbox could still have trouble persuading a doubtful Wall Street money machine, which has shown little love for cloud companies, that it can overcome several hurdles:
Those issues aside, Dropbox has a lot going for it. It didn’t secure a $10 billion valuation for nothing. It’s a hot cloud company that has raised over a billion dollars. It claims over 400 million registered users with 8 million companies using the service. It put file sync and share on the map and has changed the way we exchange files. 
That kind of traction should mean the company is capable of overcoming anything we outline here, but it may have some educating to do on Wall Street whenever it decides to move forward with an IPO.
The Subscription Business Hurdle
Dropbox sells its consumer and business products on a recurring basis. As you have heard myriad times by now, companies that sell digital services using a subscription model — SaaS shops, in other words — collect revenue over time, and record costs up front.
That means that as you grow as a SaaS company, you are building a predictable revenue stream over time, in the face of often stiff losses as growth ROI has yet to catch up. It’s a fine model, provided that a startup doesn’t overpay for new accounts, and that those accounts eventually generate a multiple of their initial cost to acquire. (Or, if you prefer the boring version, it’s a fine model if your gross margins are in the eighty percent range, and your LTV to CAC ratio is greater than three.)
Dropbox’s consumer business evolved last year, when the company lowered the price it charges for storage; in the face of crashing storage costs, other providers of cloud storage offered dramatically lower prices. Dropbox put off lowering its own prices, but eventually had little choice but acquiesce. We’ll touch on the price question in a moment, but keep in mind that Dropbox’s consumer mind and market share are important tools to get Dropbox into corporations that may become enterprise customers. 
So, Dropbox couldn’t afford, somewhat ironically, to abandon competing for consumer share as that could have added friction to its enterprise sales process.
That brings us to Box. Given that the Dropbox ‘For Business product competes with other EFSS players that sell into the enterprise, we can use market analogs to grok how public investors are valuing SaaS firms at current tip. So, Box. And things don’t look great: As of Friday, Box is trading just above (barely) its $14 per share IPO price.
So, despite Box posting better-than-expected financial performance in its most recent quarter, and boosting its full-year guidance, shares in the popular firm are trading at all-time lows.

The implication is that investors are less bullish on SaaS losses in the short-term. That could be predicated on merely shifting sentiment towards companies with cheaper revenue growth, or it could simple be that investors are shifting cash to firms that have a faster ramp to profitability.
I’ve heard every story and then some about Dropbox’s financial performance. From that, we can say nothing. However, we can understand that if Dropbox shares the various weaknesses that Box once had, and has hauled ass to rein in, it could have a hard time explaining to investors why it is worth so much more than its competitor. 
Venture capitalists love the predictability of SaaS revenue growth. But when public investors are spooked, positive cash flow can be even more attractive.
The Business Definition Hurdle
Before Dropbox came along, we kluged a number of work-arounds to move our files across devices such as emailing them to ourselves or using thumb drives to move them from device to device “sneaker-net” style.
With a tool like Dropbox, your files sit in one place and you access them from anywhere on virtually any device. It became so easy to move files that before you knew it, we were moving our files to and from work via Dropbox. In fact, this practice became so widespread that by around the 2012 timeframe, it became known as the “Dropbox problem” in IT, emblematic of new class of software that enabled employees to provision their own tools in the cloud, and move company content  — usually without official permission.
Given that kind of heady freedom, and simply wanting to get their work done, people flocked to tools like Dropbox — and its user numbers soared.
As this was happening, Dropbox recognized that these millions of users represented a business opportunity, but only if it could turn some of those users, many of whom were using the free version, into paying customers. 
The problem is that consumers are conditioned not to pay on the internet. The surest way to get paying customers was to create a business version with some protections and administrative controls built in. In April of last year, it released Dropbox for business and has been refining it ever since.
On one hand, this hybrid approach is a great business model. You have the hundreds of millions of consumers using the tool and it makes perfect sense that a business would want to tap into that popularity and give their employees what they want. The downside to this approach is that Wall Street may wonder where the company’s true focus lies. If it leans too heavily on consumers, it could run smack dab into the next hurdle  — convincing Wall Street it isn’t in a commoditized business racing to the bottom with technology industry giants.
The Storage Race To The Bottom Hurdle
Returning to our prior notes on pricing, there is a question of value. Dropbox cannot compete in selling storage; it can’t have a lower cost profile than larger cloud players who can invest at scale to lower marginal storage costs. This is one advantage of being a monied incumbent.

Without that option, Dropbox can compete on productivity apps, platform quality, security, its developer network, integration with OEM handset shops, and first-party apps. But so can its competition.
Having seen a former revenue lever — storage capacity — removed from its revenue growth toolbox, at least in part, shifts the onus of top line to other income sources. For a very rough analogy, newspapers had a hell of a time transitioning from classified ad income. That’s business.
All of this doesn’t mean the situation is hopeless. We know the markets are going to do what they do and Dropbox will very likely wait for a more opportune moment. CEO Drew Houston has been answering these types of questions since he launched the company in 2007. As Wall Street stiffens against tech in general and cloud in particular, the company is going to have its work cut out for it. Whenever that magic IPO moment happens, it’s just going to have to deal with it.

Jeff Thermond is a venture partner at XSeed Capital.
If you’ve ever run a 10K road race, you know that race organizers spend a lot of effort to have volunteers at every milepost telling runners what their time is. If you’re like me, you’ve probably sped up at each marker as you strove to beat your personal best time.
The key lesson here is that more information leads to a better result, and sales management and distance running both share the quality that more frequent information about performance drives to a measurably better result at the end. I was reminded of this recently when I read Jason Lemkin’s blog on the inevitability of moving from monthly to quarterly quotas as an SaaS company matures.
I’ve spent a third of my career running sales organizations. I think Lemkin picked a great and timely topic, and his blog is well worth reading. I did have slightly different thoughts on a few of his conclusions, though, and I’d like to share them in the form of some questions and reflections.
Why have quotas at all? Can’t I just pay a fixed percent of bookings and be done with it?
Sure, one can do that, but almost no one does. Why? Because just like running a 10K race, when runners get near their goal, they speed up, no matter how tired they are. When sales people can see a way to break through their quota, they sell harder and work longer. Quota-carrying sales reps work harder than they would without them. Millions of sales reps over the past century have proven this.
Does the length of my typical sales cycle affect the smallest unit of time and the quota attached to it?
Absolutely! If one is selling something where prospects can dependably be closed on a first call, then it might be possible to have daily targets for activity and weekly quotas for bookings.
Although SaaS prospects usually convert faster than prospects for software licenses with a big upfront payment, all other things being equal, most software does not usually have one-week close cycles.
I hold a weekly one-hour call with all my reps to review their forecasts. Can’t that take the place of setting a monthly quota?
Here’s the problem with this alternative: Sales reps that derive a significant amount of their compensation from meeting their quotas only care about the factors that affect that compensation.
Unless there is some unusual clause in your company’s sales compensation plan that places a heavy portion of the compensation on forecast accuracy, sales reps will pay little attention to meeting their forecast if they can put that attention toward beating their quota instead. Many salespeople treat forecasts as “red tape,” and may actually resent spending time on forecasting their business.
For sales compensation plans to be effective, they need to be aligned with the behavior the business wants to reinforce. Monthly quota-driven compensation plans force the reps to care a lot about their monthly targets and how to achieve them.
Underlying this whole discussion is the desire to smooth out bookings during the quarter. Why is that important? And aren’t their other techniques to get customers to close earlier?
There are multiple benefits to smoothing out revenue. The most important is predictability. Because one of two successful financial exits is an IPO, it is worth noting that it is easier to get a high P/E ratio for a business with dependable, consistent growth rather than for one with erratic big swings in bookings.
But even before an IPO, the earlier business closes in a time period (month, quarter, year), the better the chance of making that target for the time period. Monthly quotas, set realistically, can motivate sales reps to smooth out bookings and support the business’ overall revenue goals.
What about other techniques? Jason Lemkin’s blog post suggests giving sales reps discretion to offer bigger discounts for business that closes early in the quarter. In an SaaS business, gross margins are inherently healthy, so why not do that?
It is certainly true that only monumental discounting will seriously affect the gross margin percentage of an SaaS business, and that metric is watched closely by investors in any type of business.
However, what broad discounting will do is lower ASP’s over time, which lowers the size of the served available market. If the market a company is going after is huge, that may be fine. And if the average customer only buys once, then this may be appropriate.
But if the company expects lots of expansion business from its prospects, early discounts will unnecessarily lower the future price that customer is willing to pay, and limit the size of the resultant cash flows by a substantial amount. That is never a good thing.
If I have to set 12 quota targets per year rather than just four, isn’t that a lot more work for me?
No. Every venture-backed business I know has a yearly operating plan. Those plans set budgets for bookings, revenue and expenses by month. All one has to do is figure out how much quota over-assignment is optimal to have “on the street,” then disaggregate that number across all the reps.
And if one is already holding weekly forecast calls, one can talk about whether they’re going to hit their bookings number as well as their forecasts during the same call. It should not add any time to one’s day to use monthly quotas versus quarterly.
The blog suggested that the move from monthly to quarterly quotas is inevitable as the business grows. Is that inevitable?
I don’t believe so. I’ve even seen many companies transition from quarterly to monthly as they grew in order to improve confidence in sales forecasts for all the reasons listed above. One particular networking company I know uses monthly sales quotas and is generating more than a billion dollars in bookings.
Are there types of businesses where you would not use monthly quotas?
Sure. If I had a business where each deal was so large and so complex that a rep could only work two or three at a time (e.g., government or military contracts where the deal variables are multi-faceted and sales cycles are 2-4 years), then that business would probably not be improved by a monthly bookings quota. However, I am unable to think of a single SaaS business with that characteristic.
If you are running an SaaS business, and you want to grow a large, predictable business, closing business earlier in the quarter is a highly desirable goal. Sales management can be tasked with that, but driving a monthly bookings quota down to the reps and paying them on those monthly goals will cause them to switch their behavior at month’s end from indifference or mild annoyance to rapt attention to focus on beating that goal.
Do that and you’ll soon find yourself celebrating their (and the business’) wins as they sprint to the finish line every month, and not just every quarter.

Micah Rosenbloom is a venture partner at Founder Collective.
Warby Parker is astonishingly successful, whether you judge it by the rave reviews of customers, its valuation or, more impressively, by the number of startups that compare themselves to the iconic eyeglass innovator. Over the last couple of years, I’ve met with dozens of entrepreneurs who have pitched themselves as the “Warby of ________.”
Disrupting any category is difficult, but the consumer goods space can be one of the hardest, given the entrenched competitors, myriad channels and the need to appeal to ever-changing consumer tastes and trends. In the past, VCs rarely ventured into areas that seemed more like consumer packaged goods (CPG) than pure technology, but these lines have blurred. Some of the biggest successes here in the NYC tech scene sell glasses (Warby), mattresses (Casper) and razors (Harry’s/Dollar Shave Club).
Many of the “Warby of X” startups are attractive. The products are generally well designed. Their marketing strategies seem plausible. But so far, we haven’t invested in any. I fear that many of the more recent consumer product-oriented startups put too much stock in their ability to build a brand, or — even worse — their ability to hire an agency to build the brand for them. Strong marketing is certainly necessary, but not sufficient for building venture-scale businesses. These companies have all found something more significant, usually the industry structure itself, to exploit to their advantage.
When discussing these companies, people too often focus on the design and not enough on the deep understanding of the market structures they exploit. Slick messaging and innovative industrial design capture consumer attention, but it’s the founder’s focus on outsize profit margins that captures VC interest.
Eye care in the U.S., and most of the world, is dominated by a Italian company called Luxottica. You’ve probably never heard of them, but they control 80 percent of the market for eyeglasses. They’ve locked up licensing deals with Oakley, Prada, Dolce & Gabbana and basically every other high-end brand to design fashionable specs. They manufacture their own glasses and have purchased or partnered with the best category retailers, including LensCrafters, Pearle Vision and Sunglass Hut to dominate distribution. They even provide optical insurance!
Like Apple, Luxottica has vertically integrated to such a degree that it’s very difficult for anyone else to compete. Luxottica has a near monopoly on eye care, and their scale makes it difficult for anyone to wedge their way into the value chain. Anyone who wants to compete needs the will, capital and connections to recreate the entire supply chain. This strategy has performed beautifully. Luxottica earned revenues of $7.6 billion in 2014 and took 68 percent in gross margin.
The eye-care market is especially difficult to crack because of the necessity of prescriptions. In the past, eyeglasses were generally purchased at the site of one’s eye doctor. Moving a prescription was cumbersome, and these eye docs often made it difficult to transfer it. No wonder the waiting rooms of many docs were filled with frames — in essence, they were running a retail practice coupled with a medical office. Because Luxottica owns many of these storefronts, they’re able to capture margin at every step of the process.
What Warby was able to capitalize on was the increasing ease and comfort modern consumers expect when shopping. Warby has innovated the ordering process — with online and offline try-ons, 60-80 percent cost reductions and easy returns, they were able remove the friction of buying specs online. Warby could undercut Luxottica on cost and offer a unique aesthetic, while still retaining healthy margins.
This isn’t the case in most markets, and it isn’t easy. Warby had to go “full stack” from Day One, building, branding and shipping their glasses, but it earned Warby a healthy valuation for its efforts. Nonetheless, these important, yet idiosyncratic aspects of the eyewear industry don’t neatly cut and paste into other categories.
Eyeglasses and mattresses seem to be completely different product categories, but the market dynamics are very similar. The $9 billion U.S. mattress market is essentially controlled by two private equity firms who bought up the most valuable brands in the market. The companies that ran these businesses cost-engineered the products to make them cheaper to produce, for instance, by making mattresses singled-sided — which forces more frequent replacements. Mattresses are big and bulky, and rely on specialty retail locations staffed by salespeople that make used-car salesman look honest. Still, limiting competition and channels meant margins were protected. Until Casper came along.
Casper cuts through this knot by shipping a full-sized mattress in a conventional box via UPS or courier. Its memory foam design and innovations in packaging allow the mattress to be shipped without the typical hassle of scheduling a delivery, having moving guys traipse through your home and plop a mattress in your bedroom. The mattress is heavily compressed and packaged such that it expands when opened and serves as a compelling brand touchpoint — just watch one of the thousands of unboxing videos on YouTube — it’s worth it!
Casper has been able to create a differentiated product at a low cost, figure out a better way to sell and deliver, all while keeping margin along the way.
Like the market for glasses and mattresses, the $3 billion U.S. razor market is huge and concentrated, with Gillette and Schick accounting for 70-90 percent of sales. However, the razor business uses a completely different playbook than the one established by the mattress barons.
The two leading razor makers invest a small fortune in R&D, figuring out how to put more blades on every flat surface on the razor, adding battery-powered features and “track balls” to create the perfect “shave.” They then protected these innovations, as well as the simpler ones that actually make their razors useful, with patents — which cause prices to spiral upwards. Razors have never been better, but that fanaticism for follicle removal comes with an obscene price tag.
Enter Harry’s and Dollar Shave Club. Both companies found razors that were “good enough,” secured manufacturing relationships and built brands around them. They stripped all the extraneous stuff, sought a direct-to-consumer relationship and have captured significant market share as a result.
Most innovative companies would shy away from competing with the likes of P&G or Schick. Not Harry’s. Instead, they purchased a world-class blade production factory in Germany. They realized that while they could disrupt the $5+ retail cost of competitive blades, they needed a high-quality product. People (and their skin) are sensitive when it comes to shaving. Additionally, I suspect Harry’s has to work carefully to avoid infringing on patents, but their success of late has certainly given the big guys a bit of a market-share haircut while earning sharp valuations.
All three of these businesses are characterized by a small number of competitors, structural impediments to market entry and consequently high margins. Not every business shares these dynamics. The fashion market is well served, and margins are compressed at most price points. Consumer products, without benefit of a unique and defensible IP, have a difficult time in the market. Basically, if a product can be sold on Amazon, you can be sure the margin will asymptote toward zero.
If you’re going to pitch a VC a business in the mold of Warby or Casper or Harry’s, do the work to make sure you’ll enjoy similar kinds of structural advantages. I often ask entrepreneurs what’s unique about their industry — not how is it similar to eyeglasses or mattresses but, rather, how it’s different. Founders should bathe themselves in the nuance of an industry by attending trade shows and talking to insiders.
If you don’t have these advantages, you might get early funding, but you will have a much harder time earning the valuations those companies have enjoyed. In many cases, venture capital probably is the wrong funding tool — something like Kickstarter is a better fit.
It’s not surprising that investors and entrepreneurs have taken notice of their success. VCs and founders can act a bit like lemmings. The key thing to remember is that each of these businesses has unique characteristics, and simply picking a long-ignored category and following the playbook created by these startups is by no means a recipe for success — or funding.
This isn’t to say startups in more competitive markets with thinner margins can’t take lessons from Warby Parker, Casper or Harry’s. In addition to picking great markets, the teams behind them have put on a master class when it comes to building brands and executing their businesses. Mattresses were comfy or cost-effective before Casper, but they were never cool.
These companies have demonstrated that you can build a healthy business on the back of high net promoter scores and by leveraging emerging marketing channels like podcasts and YouTube. Still, it’s just really hard to build a venture-scale business in most markets absent a structural misalignment.
I’m not saying we’d never back a CPG-focused startup, but we’ll need to see founders who understand the razor-thin difference between successful startups and also-rans.

Scott Maxwell is the founder and senior managing partner at OpenView Venture Partners, an expansion-stage B2B software venture capital firm.
In 15 years as a venture capitalist, I’ve seen just about every market condition you can imagine. I started at Insight Venture Partners in 2000 at a time when the stock market was experiencing historic highs and tech companies were receiving massive private and public valuations. Capital markets were flush, startup burn rates were rampant, and the gold rush was on. Investors came out of every corner trying to get a piece of the pie.
We all know how that ended.
Fast forward to 2006, when I founded OpenView Venture Partners. Markets had rebounded from the 2001 disaster, and investment capital was beginning to flow back into VCs and tech startups. With a reasonably good idea and a solid team, most tech startups could secure growth capital. The environment wasn’t quite as crazy as 2000, but it was close.
Then, 2008 happened — and we all know how that ended.
Which brings us to today. While tech investment and VC activity climbed to its highest levels since 2000 last year, there’s a growing sentiment that we’ve reached a precipice. Private valuation euphoria seems to be dissipating. Tech IPOs are down (and the tech startups that have gone public are generally under-performing). Volatility in broader markets is creating uncertainty.
The combination of those factors is leading to some prognostication about the possibility of another tech bubble, but I don’t think we’re heading toward 2001 or 2008 again. Instead, what we’re experiencing now is more indicative of the market’s tolerance for higher-risk investments given those investments’ performance and other economic factors. For many, that trend is a harbinger for disaster. But in my book, it could be a good thing for the tech and VC industries as a whole.
Before I explain my point of view, I think it’s important to explore two forces that most often influence the ebbs and flows of tech investment participation, private valuations and startup cash burn: Greed and fear.
During the good times — when macroeconomic volatility and uncertainty is low — euphoria begets greed and you see much larger pockets of risk-on activities. In this environment, more investors have more money to deploy, and they’re more comfortable rolling the dice with higher risk investments. As a result, it’s far easier (and cheaper) for entrepreneurs to acquire and spend capital.
And why wouldn’t they? If capital is cheap and investing it in the business has the potential to yield exponential growth, why wouldn’t they “burn” it? This is no different from how most savvy individuals manage cash during periods of low-interest rates and strong economic growth. When capital is cheap and market opportunities appear high, you borrow for large purchases and invest cash in areas that have potential for a high return. (It’s important to clarify that I’m talking about deploying good capital on good financial opportunities, not raising and spending money just because you can.)
In the not so good times — think 2001 and 2008 — instability and volatility begets fear, which creates a very different ecosystem. Capital markets become more conservative (or freeze up entirely), which naturally raises the cost of acquiring that capital. VCs are choosier about the investments they make and terms become much less founder-friendly.
For startups with a sound economic model in a less competitive market, this might lead to a brief retraction in growth, but improved organizational efficiency. For startups with poor unit economics or a growth model that’s dependent on rapid cash burn to acquire users and tip gross margins in their favor, fear in the capital markets can be deadly.
In the financial world, this ebb and flow phenomenon is often referred to as risk-on, risk-off investing, and it tends to create herd-like behavior.
In my mind, there’s little doubt that the VC and tech worlds are beginning to shift from greed to fear (or, risk-on to risk-off). Private valuations are beginning to normalize. Fewer tech startups are going public. And “tourist” VCs — hedge funds, public asset managers, and corporate venture capital groups that dabble in tech VC when market conditions are favorable — are starting to return home.
Additionally, there are several macroeconomic factors that are creating market uncertainty and, thus, less enthusiasm around riskier investments. Specifically:
Collectively, these factors are creating risk-off preference in the market, which is lowering investors’ appetite for investments with unclear opportunities for a return. In the short-term, this will accelerate the demise of startups with poor economic models that previously relied on investor euphoria and the tech industry’s momentum to achieve sky-high valuations. And it will probably make it more difficult for some startups to acquire the runway necessary to test and prove the value of their ideas.
But this trend isn’t bad news for everyone.
For the startups that were fundamentally constructed to thrive in both lean and rich times, I don’t expect much to change. Focus and discipline have a way of insulating businesses against the ebbs and flows of the marketplace. If the capital markets are indeed moving toward a risk-off strategy, then these types of institutions will simply adapt.
For instance, a startup with sound unit economics might simply ramp down investment in product development or marketing and work harder to improve gross margins. Profitability, after all, has a funny way of limiting the need for outside capital.
The same is true in the venture capital industry.
For VCs that maintained a disciplined investment ethos and resisted the temptation to follow the herds toward trendy, high-risk opportunities, this new market uncertainty is less of a concern. In fact, in some ways, it’s beneficial.
In a risk-off environment, tourist investors move money out of VC and entrepreneurs are left with the fundamental investment groups that deeply understand their company’s needs, challenges and opportunities. In that environment, the capital that’s deployed is of higher quality and the value that’s created is significantly higher. Yes, fewer companies will go public in that setting, but the ones that do will be healthier and, thus, much more appealing to investors.
So, is the gold rush over? Not exactly. It’s just on hiatus. At the end of the day, markets tend to be cyclical. As valuations normalize and more disciplined investors pour money into more disciplined companies, it will yield successes that have a positive trickle down effect on the broader marketplace. When that happens, guess what’s right around the corner?
You got it: The risk-on herd. And when it comes back, capital will flow like water again, questionable economic models will return, burn rates will climb, and the valuation hand wringing will begin anew.

Tesla missed the street in its reported Q3 earnings today, including non-GAAP revenue of $1.24 billion and non-GAAP loss per share of $0.58. Analysts expected a non-GAAP loss per share of $0.50. The company’s non-GAAP revenue also missed analyst estimates of $1.26 billion.
But the real story here is on the amount of cars delivered this year.
Tesla produced a total of 13,091 and delivered 11,603 cars in Q3 2015. The company originally planned to sell 50,000 to 55,000 cars this year, which would be a 70 percent increase in cars sold in 2014. However, that estimate was lowered after Tesla reported its preliminary Q3 delivery figure of 11,580, just above guidance.
Hoping to make up for the miss, Tesla guidance is for 17,000 to 19,000 car deliveries in Q4 2015. The biggest constraint here would be for Model X production. The supply of components for the Model X has been a big factor in production, according to Tesla. The company will bring production of certain components in-house going forward.
In a letter to shareholders, the company said production of Model X vehicles should improve “sequentially” under this plan.
We expect our average vehicle sales price to increase slightly in Q4 with more deliveries of highly optioned Model X vehicles. We expect Q4 Model S gross margin to improve sequentially, but initial Model X launch expenses and higher overhead and depreciation allocations will temporarily elevate total production costs in Q4. As a result, we expect non-GAAP Automotive gross margin to decline slightly from Q3. After Model X production stabilizes in Q1 2016, we expect Model X gross margin to improve rapidly and become comparable to Model S gross margin over the next several quarters, even as we launch a lower priced version of Model X with a smaller battery pack during 2016
In regular trading, the stock was down by 2.54 percent, closing at $208.35. It was up by 7.27 percent in after-hours trading.
Tesla stock was at an all-time high of $291.42 in September 2014, but began to decelerate from there to $185 in March of this year. It started picking up steam again this May, but the stock took a tumble again last month after Consumer Report pulled its recommendation, citing new information on the car’s reliability.
Some other interesting news gleaned from today’s Q3 2015 report has to do with Tesla’s plan to invest $500 million in Q4 – much of that investment will go toward speeding up production in Tesla’s Gigafactory to keep pace with the plan for Model X production.

Diversity of ideas and founders is the 500 Startups way. So it’s fitting that the accelerator’s 11th Mountain View batch would feature an extraordinarily wide range of companies; from those tackling huge problems like recruiting and health in the Arab world, to more “niche to win” businesses focused on picture framing or cookie delivery. Investors I spoke to weren’t particularly excited about this Demo Day’s set, but time will tell if some can expand into adjacent markets to become the type of startups VC drool over.
500 Startups partner Sean Percival explained that some of the ideas might seem small because his incubator prefers companies with live products and “we’re really looking for early traction.” That contrasts sharply with fellow accelerator Y Combinator, which has begun investing in hard-science companies in areas like nuclear energy that can take years to get to market.

Percival was proud to note that 37% of this batch’s startups have at least one female founder. “We’re a more welcoming place” he tells me. To keep up that diversity, not just in gender but race, location, and ideas, 500 Startups has been traveling around the world doing info sessions in major metro areas to teach entrepreneurs about the benefits of accelerators. Many startups feel like they might have been around too long to join something like 500 Startups, but Percival insists that “Unless you’re Series A, you’re not too late.”
500 Startups has now invested in 400 companies across 17 cohorts from its Mountain View, Mexico City, and San Francisco locations. Here are our picks for the top companies from the 11th Mountain View batch, followed by the others in the class:
Brazil is booming. There are cranes everywhere. There are over 200,000 construction companies in the countries. The number of construction equipment rental companies grew from 1000 in 2008 to over 5000 now, and they all need equipment. Vaivolta wants to replace the traditional model where one company owns equipment and rents it out, and instead creates a fluid marketplace for rentals across providers. Customers can choose based on different equipment models, reputation, services offered, and price. It’s a $3.5 billion a year market that’s growing, yet it lacks the marketplace technology that has been so successful for companies like Airbnb, Vaivolta wants to take the headaches out of wearing a hard-hat.

While grocery and meal delivery services like Instacart and Sprig are blowing up, no one is touching baked goods. That’s why Doughbies built a system that can delivery fresh-baked cookies and other confections in under 20 minutes. Baked goods are supposedly a $50 billion a year business, while food gifting is another $21 billion. Doughbies is growing 120% a month. It booked just $7,000 in revenue in January, but it has 90% gross margins and is only operating in four zip codes for 20 hours a week. I’m a chocolate chip cookie fanatic, and when I tried theirs, I was very impressed. And the company was certainly a hit of 500 Startups’ Demo Day, as it pulled an ‘Opera’ and had a cookie waiting beneath everyone’s chairs at the end of their pitch.
Games are pricey to buy new, but players can quickly get bored with them, making gaming an expensive hobby. 99Gamers can help gamers buy cheaper and sell their old games. Since the marketplace uses a proxy digital currency called Coins, there are no transaction fees for buying and selling. Sellers just pay shipping. The catch is you can’t cash out. You have to spend your Coins on more games. With 240,000 members it’s already the biggest dedicated video game re-sale marketplace, and 99Gamers has a stunning 97% margin. Its goal is to displace eBay with a community just for game lovers.

Expense reports are annoying, time-consuming, and rife with fraud. There’s $441 billion a year in fraudulent expenses. AppZen’s artificial intelligence system can fix this by replacing human expense auditors with algorithms. AppZen’s engine can detect wrongful charges for strip clubs, expensive lunches with friends, groceries, and more. The startup claims to offer instant ROI through audit time savings of 50%, and 80% saved employee time. AppZen’s already done $445,000 in bookings for its enterprise SAAS product with customers like Gartner and LinkedIn. AppZen could make you and your boss stop dreading expense reports.

Cemeteries use paper and old school spreadsheets to manage their land and know where to dig. But these outdated systems can lead to errors and expensive lawsuits when graves are dug in the wrong place and someone’s Rest In Peace is disturbed. PlotBox offers a SAAS for cemeteries and crematoria that helps them manage their land and bookings. The startup can use drones to quickly scan cemeteries for free plots much faster than traditional methods. It scanned a 50 acre cemetery via drone in 30 minutes when it would have taken 100 hours normally. PlotBox has $280,000 in closed sales already, and is hoping to kill the old cemetery management systems to bring technology to a $3 billion US market.
PlotBox drone-maps cemeteries
Scoring potential employees is a haphazard process that leads to sub-optimal hiring. Everyone has a different idea of what to look for in a job candidate. But Techpear can measure cultural fit, and test a candidate’s knowledge on what they’ll be working on with industry-expert written quizzes. The company found early interest in its product from Slack and Zalora. Hiring the wrong employee can be toxic for a small startup. Big data has changed everything else about business, and now it’s changing how those businesses hire.

Travelers spend $84 billion a year on last-minute activities during vacations. Headout offers a marketplace for buying these tours, sports activities, and cultural experiences. Headout has had 4000 users so far who’ve spent $1.2 million total to book adventures within 24 hours. Headout takes a 20% commission, and plans to expand to 11 more markets this year. Most travel activity bookings still happen offline, but Headout could change that. Other startups like Vayable, Viator, and Peek are competing in the space, but Headout hopes its mobile-first, last-minute approach will make it the traveller’s choice.
It’s tough to find a doctor if you live in the Arab world. Without doctors they trust, patients go to the emergency room if something goes wrong which can rack up huge unnecessary costs. eTobb makes it easy to anonymously ask real doctors a question for free, browse doctors through its online profiles, and even book appointments. eTobb helps put doctors in the Arab world online so they can be discovered, and help their people stay healthy.

Women want answers to life’s questions. They can get them from the crowd or field experts with HeTexted. Those questions range from ‘How do I get an ex-boyfriend to stop bothering me?’ to “Should I go on a second date with the guy I met on Tinder?”  HeTexted has seen 3 million user sessions, 100,000 questions asked and answered, and has 70,000 hardcore users who’ve visited over 200 times. It’s already been featured on Good Morning America and Forbes, partnered with Conde Nast and Buzzfeed, and grown 51% since joining 500 Startups. The company believes that beyond its service, its viral content has long-term value. HeTexted could turn the whole female gender into a community of mentors.

Many home cleaning services are mom & pops that are still offline. Cleanify brings them online alongside franchised shops and online services like Homejoy to create an aggregated marketplace of cleaning services. Users can compare pricing, scheduling availability, and reviews of all the options that serve their location. The company is now at a $2 million run rate and is growing 40% month over month. Rather than get frustrated when you favorite cleaner can’t squeeze you in before your big party, Cleanify can find you the next-best, or an even better service to make your home look perfect.

When you use mobile chat apps you can often only chat with other mobile users, and you often have to connect with them on a social network. Connected2.me gives you a unique URL that people can use to message you, and you can also chat anonymously or with a random stranger ChatRoulette-style. The app has 2.7 million users and haven’t done any paid marketing. The company serves ads and also has premium features, making it profitable already. While WhatsApp has just started to roll out a web interface, it’s a huge space where Connected2.me might be able to carve out a piece of the pie.

When someone messages you, knowing what’s been up in their life before you ask can benefit your business or social life. Blinq jacks into your messaging app, and if you press its little dot, it will reveal important information about your conversation partner. It has 15,000 downloads and a 4.5 star rating. Blinq is trying to become the biggest context database ever by listening to your notifications.

If you know what your customers want or what your competitors are doing, you’re more likely to succeed. Luckily they’re blurting this out on social media. Socialight analyzes any set of customers, competitors, or other group of public social accounts, and relays actionable data to its clients. For example, it knows that recruiting ads for software engineers do better with the word “Developer” in Detroit, but “Programmer” in Miami as that’s how people talk in those different locations. Socialight can also use contests, polls, and other interactive methods to pull important data for the crowd. It’s already seen $75,000 in bookings since January 1st from companies like Microsoft, Eventbrite, Udemy, and Castrol. Sometimes the big data you have to analyze is just floating out in the open.
Most small merchants don’t have the expertise to run great social ads themselves, or the money to pay for expensive enterprise adtech tools. Funnely offers an affordable system that converts an ecommerce site into ads that run to the right people at the right time. Funnely claims to be able to boost sales and conversion rates for businesses, while letting merchants focus on their business not their ads.
Some say our attention span has dropped to just 2.8 seconds, so Catnip is delivering content that fits into that tiny window. It’s app is a feed of the top memes from Reddit, Imgur, Twitter, and other social and humor sites. It’s scored 1 million uses in eight months and claims some stay an average of 13 minutes per day. It might not fix the big problems in the world, but Catnip could brighten the dull little moments of your day.
When a gamer loves the game they’re playing, is thankful for a teammate who saved their ass, or wants to compliment one of their eSports heroes, there’s no way to show their gratitude. Most payment systems charge too high of fees to make microtransactions feasible. But Coinding wants to let gamers tip developers and fellow players with Bitcoin since it’s essentially free to transfer. If it works, Coinding could make the gaming universe a little more friendly.

Finally, lean startup methodology has come to the clumsy picture framing business. Mountary makes it easy to get things framed. You give it your art’s dimensions, and it sends you a kit with a frame, plexiglass, mat, and hanging materials, and you do it yourself. Mountary currently cites 52% margins and big cart sizes in this $2 billion US market. While the idea of a framing startup might seem a little silly, long-term it plans to use the market as a beachhead for invading the bigger home decor business.

When you make a donation, the dollars could go to overhead, distribution costs, corruption, and more before they reach the intended recipients. Paykind wants to cut out all the middle men for the $42 billion in aid sent to Africa each year. It lets you send an electronic voucher for specific goods or services to someone in need. The voucher arrives on their phone and they can redeem it at local stores. Studies are beginning to show that direct giving works better than distributing funds to traditional non-profits. Paykind makes this kind of charity easier than ever.

Arabic for “obituaries and condolences”, Elwafeyat wants to make commemorating someone’s life easier. Right now, obituaries can cost as much as $1500, only show up in limited places like local newspapers, and it can take time to get them written. Elwafeyat’s $50 service boasts a quick turn around time, and will make the obituary available on the web as well. With 30% month over month growth, the company is seeing people use Elwafeyat not just for obits, but to send custom condolences to loved ones.

Normally to use a 3D printer, you have to install a ton of hardcore design software and fiddle with tons of settings. Astroprint makes it simple to print your own designs, print remotely, and eventually plans to have a 3D printables design marketplace. It hit its Kickstarter goal in a day and went to raise 400% of what it planned. Astroprint wants to do for 3D printers what Windows did for computers: make them accessible to the masses.

There are currently 1.3 million apps in the App Store and millions of crashes per day. Developers need to test their app in several different devices and platforms to make sure it works correctly. This can take a lot of time and work to stay up on. Native tap is a platform that allows mobile developers to test on over 500 different platforms on one tablet. Developers can access any device they need to test remotely through the tablet app as if it was right in front of them. Native tap supports many platforms including iOS, Android, Mac, Linux and Windows.
Studypool co-founder Richard Werbe was the type of student that other students were constantly asking for help on tests and various questions they were having trouble with understanding in their classes. Werbe thought he should get paid for that and created Studypool with his friend and co-founder Jimmy Zhong to help him and other students do just that. The platform connects students with specific questions to tutors who can give them help 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.  It promises to reduce the response time downy to 11 minutes. Werbe says the company has an $800,000 run rate and that the average transaction is around $13 per question.

The site offers fine Italian men’s and women’s clothing items such leather shoes and sweaters. These are items that you can’t usually get without actually going to Italy to buy them. Founder Raffaele Giovine says it is already the largest Italian luxury marketplace in 50 countries, with 20 brand offerings included on the site. Italist manages all this without carrying any inventory. It is a U.S. based startup with over 100 employees. It has $2 million ARR and 50 percent growth month-over-month.

According to a recent report, Twilio wants to go public. Twilio, a company that provides software-based communications tools for developers, closed out 2014 on a $100 million annual run rate. Or, put another way, Twilio brought in just over $8 million in top line last December.
Box, New Relic and Hortonworks each recently proved that the IPO window is open and that investors have an appetite for quickly growing, if yet unprofitable, technology shares. Box, New Relic, Hortonworks and Twilio also share a focus on selling products to other corporations. Assuming that Twilio is not yet profitable, it grew within expectations in 2014, and has not radically decided to change its business, it is an analogous company in the financial sense to the three1.
The three public firms saw their shares pop during their first trading days. In the case of Box, shares jumped so high that there was some griping that the company had left too much ‘money on the table’ during its debut.
Let’s find the core similarities between Box, New Relic and Hortonworks and compare it to what we know about Twilio. Then let’s find points of similarity and determine the set of characteristics that the market seems to currently covet.2
Three companies, three IPOs and three big first days. What else do Box, New Relic and Hortonworks share? Let’s take a look:
50%+ Revenue Growth? Yes:
Losses? Yes:
Heavily Capitalized? Yes:
Now let’s take a look at Twilio’s numbers to try to get a handle on what sort of shape the company is in. As noted, Twilio closed 2014 with a $100 million revenue run rate. The same report indicated that Twilio was accreting $1 million in new annual recurring revenue (ARR) per month. The company charges on both a recurring and event-based basis, which means that we can’t directly compare the growth of its ARR to its aggregate forward revenue that we have, but it seems that at current pace, Twilio will not grow less than 50 percent this year.
I have no data on Twilio’s profitability, but I haven’t heard that it is profitable. The company — with whom I confirmed the $100 million number as a run-rate figure and not a trailing revenue sum, declined to share information on its cash flow status — i.e. declined to comment on its gross margins, or profitability.
I asked Tony Jamous, CEO of Twilio competitor Nexmo, if he had comment on the potential of Twilio being profitable. Jamous says that he “doubts” that the competing firm is profitable, given “how much they invest in marketing and headcount[.]”
Why would Twilio go public now? Its last funding round of some $70 million took place in June of 2013, or nearly 21 months ago. As such, Twilio is outside of the normal 18-month period during which a company spends the bulk of its most recent round of capital. The company could need additional capital to grow and reach profitability, and it might prefer to public markets to the private.
Twilio has raised $103.7 million to date.
The old rule: A company had to record four or five quarters of consecutive, rising profit before it could go public. For the technology sector, when revenue growth is god, and everything else is distraction, we need a new way to decide if a company Really Should Go Public.
The new rules:
The first rule fuels the second which allows for the third. Or, you raise capital to spend it more quickly than you grow your revenue in the short term so that it operates as a catapult for your top-line once you have accreted the proper recurring revenue. That means growing revenues, continued losses and a large capital backing.
You can actually, if you want, read the list backwards, assuming the third rule as a premise, and the other two, in reverse order, as preceding steps that have to be executed first.
Call the list the Rules Of The QE Era Of Tech IPOs.
Our rules are actually nearly anti-rules, as they are low-water marks for the most part. But the tougher numbers are how you get to the brighter numbers, so, for now, investors are willing to pay for short-term losses.
In between the IPOs or profitable companies, and our top-line focused trio, are companies that are on the cusp of profitability and are looking to go public. This group is the middle ground — perhaps a bit more aggressive with their spend, but with less scary red entries.
Companies like Nexmo and Egnyte fit this mold. Nexmo was on a $72 million run rate last September. The company has raised, compared to our triplets, a far more modest $22.8 million to date. Nexmo’s CEO expects to generate trailing revenue of $100 million in 2015 or more. Egnyte expects $100 million in 2015 as well, and plans to be cashflow break-even by the end of year. Both could hit go given the metrics set as acceptable by the three.
Consider the gap between the traditional rules for going public and our revised 2015 rules. I suspect the delta between the two sets shifts depending on the strength of the market. When American indexes are sitting near, or setting record highs, things get a bit loose. That laxity is enumerated in gold every time a company with accelerating losses hits go on its IPO.
Now, an exercise: What will be the new rules for IPOs in 2016?

Electric car manufacturer Tesla reported earnings today following the bell, including $1.1 billion in non-GAAP revenue, and an adjusted loss per share of $0.13. On a GAAP basis, using normal accounting methods, Tesla had a wider loss of 86 cents per share, and revenue of $957 million.
The company delivered 9,834 cars in the period. In the sequentially preceding third quarter, Tesla delivered a comparable 7,785 Model S vehicles. For the full-year period, Tesla delivered 31,655 cars.
Tesla said it built 11,627 vehicles in Q4, which meant that it matched its full-year production target of 35,000 vehicles in 2014. However, it was unable to deliver promised vehicles due to a combination of customer vacations, severe winter weather and shipping problems. Those deliveries will move into the first quarter.
The market expected Tesla to earn an adjusted $0.31 per share, on non-GAAP revenue of $1.23 billion. Tesla reports non-GAAP revenue, a somewhat rare statistic, to allow for the impacts that its Model S leasing program has on short-term top line. Both revenue figures for Tesla are worth tracking.
The company reported gross margin of 26.7 percent in the quarter, below its forecast 28 percent estimate.
In regular trading, Tesla dipped more than 2 percent. In after-hours trading shortly after its earnings release, the company was down about 3 percent. Tesla, worth north of $26 billion before it reported its financial performance, remains far off of its 52 highs, which saw its shares nearly reach the $300 mark before receding.
The company projects that in 2015, it will deliver a total of 55,000 Model S and X vehicles, which is 70 percent above its 2014 deliveries. About 40 percent of those it expects to deliver in the first half of the year.

Apple is working on a car, according to the Wall Street Journal. The Mac maker kicked off a top-secret project to develop an electric car with a minivan aesthetic, per the WSJ’s sources, after CEO Tim Cook approved the project nearly a year ago. It includes “hundreds” of staffers and is led by Ford Motor vet and Apple VP Steve Zadesky. The project involves research into battery tech, robotics and metal production, according to the paper.
The report comes hot on the heels of a Financial Times story confirming Apple R&D efforts around car tech, and goes further than either that report or an earlier one from Business Insider wherein an Apple employee reportedly confirmed some kind of car-focused project. As I wrote earlier, it makes perfect logical sense that Apple would focus some effort on this area, given the direction in which the tech industry in general is headed.
Apple has allotted for as many as 1,000 people to work on the project, according to the newest report, and the team includes former Mercedez-Benz head of R&D Johann Jungwirth. The fact that Apple’s target in this case is an electric vehicle means earlier reports that it is seeking employees from Tesla (at the same time as Tesla is attempting to poach employees from Cupertino) make a lot of sense.
The WSJ, like the FT, reports that while design and research are underway, Apple still hasn’t decided on any kind of firm product release plans. Apple has also been rumored to have been working on various other product categories in the past, including an Apple television set, which never ended up as shipping products (or haven’t yet shipped, at least).
That isn’t to say Apple will never make a car, but the fact remains that this would be a dramatic departure from the company’s core business, with huge risk involved in actually shipping anything and at this point, it’s unclear how much they’d stand to gain from such a move.
Gross margins on the iPhone range fall just under 50 percent, according to analyst estimates, and Elon Musk has promised (but not necessarily achieved) a 25 percent gross margin on every vehicle. Still, Apple has a track record of achieving premiums unheard of at competitors, so it is conceivable it could find success in the luxury car space, given its expertise with supply-chain management.
Apple also stands to make big gains in a number of other areas even if it ultimately doesn’t ship any cars – research into making a vehicle includes research about how to build software for a car, and has benefits with regards to battery and materials tech. Money spent on R&D for a car (especially an EV), therefore, even if you don’t ship a car, doesn’t go to waste.
One more thing: With the Apple Watch, Apple is clearly interested in seeing how it can extend its reputation and a premium device-maker into other categories, and it’s approaching that market as a fashion brand rather than as a straightforward gadget-maker. Car research could be another step in the same direction, with Apple exploring how its brand might translate to premium goods beyond just the home computing market.

Pandora’s earnings report for the fourth quarter of 2014 disappointed Wall Street, with revenue of $268 million and diluted earnings per share of 18 cents (that’s non-GAAP).
That means the company fell a bit short of analyst expectations for EPS of 19 cents especially on revenue, where analysts had predicted $276.5 million.
Subscription revenue was $47.9 million (up 24 percent year-over-year), while ad revenue was $220.1 million (up 36 percent). The company’s earnings release also highlights its growth on mobile, which accounted for $209.5 million in revenue — 77 percent of the total.
As for usage, Pandora says it saw 5.2 billion total listener hours in Q4, up 15 percent from the same period in 2013. There were 81.5 million active listeners, up 7 percent.
In the earnings press release, President and CEO Brian McAndrews said:
We have spent the past two years building our monetization capabilities and infrastructure to a point where we are driving healthy gross margins and are cash flow positive. 2015 will be a year in which we optimize Pandora’s potential for long-term growth. We enter the year with energy and focus on what comes next –further migrating radio budgets from terrestrial to digital, defining the future of mobile marketing and advancing Pandora’s leading role in the future of the music industry.
For the full year of 2014, Pandora saw $906.6 million in non-GAAP revenue with diluted EPS of 20 cents.
As of 4:29 p.m. Eastern time, Pandora’s stock is down more than 20 percent in after-hours trading.

Editor’s note: Hans Tung is a Managing Partner at GGV Capital and an early investor in Xiaomi Technology.
GGV Capital recently celebrated the 15th birthday of its long-time friend and former portfolio company, Alibaba, which went public in 2014. In April, we again celebrated the birthday of another dear friend, Xiaomi Technology.
Five years ago, I had the great fortune of being one of Xiaomi’s earliest investors, and I continue to marvel at its pace of execution. Today the company is among the top five smartphone makers in the world, and its sharp revenue growth has outperformed the comparative first five years of both Google and Facebook. In 2014 alone Xiaomi sold 62 million phones for US$12 billion in gross sales, becoming the most valuable, privately held company in the world with an estimated US$45 billion valuation.
And yet Xiaomi is not well-understood by many. I am frequently asked about the company’s roots, ambitions and hurdles. So, what is Xiaomi anyway?
Xiaomi represents a lifestyle especially to young consumers in China. Beyond smartphones, Xiaomi provides their first TV, their first tablet, their first wearable device, their first headphones, their first air purifier, etc. I was fortunately there at its very first Mi1 launch party in Beijing on August 16, 2011, felt the passion from its thousands of young fans first hand, and saw 450K phones preordered online in 34 hours.
Ben Thompson of Stratechery characterized Xiaomi as “the first ‘Internet of Things’ company: unlike Google (Nest), Apple (HomeKit), or even Samsung (SmartThings), all of whom are offering some sort of open SDK to tie everything together (a necessity given that most of their customers already have appliances that won’t be replaced anytime soon), Xiaomi is integrating everything itself and selling everything one needs on Mi.com to a fan base primed to outfit their homes for the very first time. It’s absolutely a vertical strategy.”
Xiaomi’s success in the highly competitive Chinese market establishes it as a trend setter and forerunner internationally, especially in emerging markets such as Brazil, India and Indonesia. Together with China, these are four of the top five largest countries (by population). But importantly, they share a comparable consumer profile to the highly dense, rapidly urbanizing Chinese market where the entire household, not just the smartphone, is up for grabs.
Having had a front-row seat in watching Xiaomi’s future unfold, startups with global ambitions can learn a lot from this company about how to innovate, grow and face critics.
Xiaomi often comes under fire for its purported lack of product originality. And they know (to paraphrase Thomson) that the further they get from their mega fans in China, the less impact intangibles such as CEO celebrity, rock-concert product announcements, powerful social media presence, etc. will have.
The product must be a winner in its own right with a direct connection to customers that is tuned to their specific needs. Xiaomi has already seen initial encouraging signs from non-Chinese fans in South East Asia and India responding well to its products.
Xiaomi updates its MiUI operating system every week. Input from beta testers made on Mi.com is regularly incorporated into the product. This disciplined listening and responsive product evolution quickly converts users into fans and fans into a marketing machine. It has also allowed Xiaomi to ignore critics and become one of the first hardware products to respond and adapt based on customer requests.
Xiaomi sells its products online, mostly from its own Mi.com site and bypasses offline retailers. This approach creates a powerful one-on-one relationship that benefits both the customer and Xiaomi. Xiaomi knows precisely what customers love, what they hate, and can communicate fixes and updates directly.
The customer service team is central to the company’s strategy and is empowered to treat customers as their own friends and to help their “friends” with their problems. All Xiaomi executives spend time in customer service to gain firsthand experience with the hot issues troubling their customers.
Xiaomi cannot build every gadget needed to realize the Xiaomi lifestyle and simultaneously ramp up global expansion. The company smartly encourages and works with VCs to back startups as part of its ecosystem in order to expand its platform and offer its customers many more low-cost products and services. Value is created in the overall growth of the ecosystem, which creates a branded experience for the customer and alignment of interest between Xiaomi and the companies in the ecosystem.
Xiaomi has openly shared that its operating expenses (including sales, marketing and G&A) are around 5 percent of total sales. Similar to Costco and Walmart, Xiaomi passes along almost this entire savings to its customers in the form of low prices on all Xiaomi products — and without sacrificing quality.
Many startups I meet today are obsessed with the Apple model of maintaining high gross margins. Yet new transparent business models, tuned to global expansion, are focused on expanding the size of the pie versus the value of a high margin slice.
Xiaomi is generous with sharing equity/options with co-founders and employees. All of the company’s seven co-founders are capable of starting their own businesses yet CEO Lei Jun has been able to recruit and retain them to help achieve his ambitious vision. Over the years, I have met many entrepreneurs who nickel and dime on equity – and then complain about how hard it is to recruit experienced talent.
There are more than 2 billion smartphones in the world today – mostly in the U.S. and China. By the end of 2020, there will be more than 4 billion smartphones. This shift to the mobile Internet, where many consumers will purchase multiple “firsts” is bigger than anything we have seen from the web, especially because of the rapid adoption and impact of mobile-everything in emerging markets.
Lessons from Xiaomi will continue to be applicable across industries and geographies. We see an increasing number of founding teams such as Xiaomi with international experience and a mobile-first view from many cities in the US and China. As we watch and work with this new breed of world-class team, I can’t help but wonder where we’ll find the next Xiaomi.

Winnow is on a mission to help the hospitality industry cut down on food waste by making the kitchen ‘smarter.’ It does this via the Winnow smart meter, a set of smart scales and accompanying tablet app that lets kitchen staff easily log what food is thrown away. That data is then uploaded to the cloud, analysed by Winnow’s algorithm, and disseminated so that food waste can be reduced.
To support its mission, the U.K. startup has raised a $900,000 seed round led by Mustard Seed’s Social Investment Fund. D:Ax, Axel Johnson’s digital venture capital fund, also participated, along with a number of private investors, including Alan Parker (former CEO of Whitbread) and Jeremy Oppenheim (head of McKinsey’s Sustainability and Resource Productivity practice).
But how big a deal is food waste? Citing data from WRAP, Winnow says the amount of food thrown away in the U.K. costs the hospitality industry over £2.5 billion annually, and that globally this figure is estimated to be at least £44 billion.
“I started Winnow because I saw a massive opportunity in solving the problem of food waste. I believe that food is too valuable to waste, and that technology can help us change the way we make food,” Marc Zornes, co-founder and CEO of Winnow, tells TechCrunch. “I started my career at a large wholesale grocers, and food and sustainability have been my two passions ever since.”
Zornes is also the co-author of the Global Institute report ‘Resource Revolution: Meeting the World’s Energy, Materials, Food, and Water Needs’, which he wrote while working as a consultant at McKinsey.
Replacing the traditional way that chefs record food waste — i.e. pen and paper — the Winnow smart meter comprises a set of scales that sits under the kitchen’s bin and connects to a tablet running the Winnow app via Bluetooth.
Kitchen staff then throw waste away as usual but use the app to log the waste via tapping on predefined food categories. The food waste data is then uploaded to Winnow’s cloud analytics platform where it is aggregated and analysed.
Finally, daily reports are sent to chefs via email which detail the top areas of waste by value giving them the insight needed to make adjustments to their operations which, Winnow claims, add up to significant savings.
In fact, the startup claims that since launching in May 2013 the Winnow smart meter, which is currently active in over 100 sites, has saved caterers, hotels, schools and restaurants over £1 million in reduced annual costs, or typically a 2-6 percent improvement in gross margins.

Videopixie, a Y Combinator alumnus that handles video creation and production (like filming and post-production editing), has raised $1.1 million in seed funding.
The startup connects clients — like retailers and brands — with video production professionals. Clients post in Videopixie what they are looking for, and the creators bid on the project. Videopixie largely sees projects that range in the $1,000 to $10,000 range, though they regularly go as high as $50,000. Videopixie cofounder Tom Saffell said the startup is bringing in more than $1 million in gross margin volume annually.
Those creators then show their portfolio of work to the buyer, who then decides which one to go with. Initially, Videopixie focused on post-production work — like video editing — but the startup quickly expanded to the all steps of the process after multiple requests from its clients. There are more than 1,000 creators using Videopixie, Saffell said. The main goal is to figure out the exact market rate for a video that a buyer is looking for, he said.
“If you ask your friends, you’d get some names of some great guys to work with,” Saffell said. “But they probably wouldn’t be interested in working with you unless you had at least $10,000. We actually have a lot of those kinds of production studios working in the $20,000 to $40,000 range, but where we’ve really opened up the market is people who have between $1,000 and $10,000. We’ve made the matching of buyers and sellers so much more efficient, and opened the process creators who you don’t know but do good work. Maybe they’re coming out of college or trying to fill a gap, but they still have talent.”
That kind of interest isn’t particularly surprising given the increasing number of video ads that appear in networks like Facebook. A good video can generally provide better engagement than ads attached to photos, and it’s quickly becoming a lucrative business for companies like Facebook.
Still, sometimes those buyers need a little bit of help to figure out how to attract the best creators for the best price. Videopixie suggests best practices and gives guidance for how they should price their projects. For example, when a buyer prices a project on the lower side, Videopixie tells them they may attract a creator that won’t produce the best video for which they are looking.
“The system is entirely fly by wire, it does work on its own, there is no manual intervention required,” Saffell said. “Everything can happen while we’re drinking cups of tea. We do occasionally help out, but one of the options when you post your project is to say, ‘I dont want to deal with it, I just want someone good, figure that out.’ That’s probably less than 10% of projects, and in those cases we do a little bit of manual work on back-end.”
The new investors include Jawed Karim, the cofounder of YouTube, as well as 500 Startups and other angels. Founded in 2013, the company has brought on two additional team members.

It’s a rare startup that closes a $20 million venture round and doesn’t bother to mention it more more than half a year. But Cloudflare, the almost-winner of TechCrunch Disrupt: SF 2010, did just that. They raised a healthy $20 million last November, on top of a more modest $2.1 million raised in 2009.
“We’re just now starting to spend the money we raised last year, CEO Matthew Prince told me yesterday, so we thought it would be a good time to announce it.” New Enterprise Associates led the new round, and previous investors Venrock and Pelion Venture Partners also participated, says the company.
The company, which offers websites a dead simple and very inexpensive content delivery network plus security and analytics platform, is on a tear. In May the websites using CloudFlare had 3.5 billion page views. Today their customers have 7 billion monthly page views, from 200 million unique users. And it’s growing about 50% per month. We’re also a customer.
That’s a significant portion of the entire online population. And that breadth of network, says Prince, helps CloudFlare keep sites fast and secure. “CloudFlare has stopped 2.1 billion attacks against its users’ websites” says the company. They have twelve data centers around the world to optimize delivery and keep things humming.
The company also has positive gross margins, meaning their revenue pays for the actual cost of delivering the service (but not headcount and other real costs, yet). They charge just $20/month to run a site, plus $5/month for additional sites from a user. There are no bandwidth or additional costs. That’s a ridiculously small fee to charge, and the big CDNs like Akamai, charging massive bandwidth and storage fees, must be taking note.

Editor’s note: Rocky Agrawal continues his in-depth guest series looking at the daily deal industry. Agrawal is an entrepreneur who has worked on local products since 1995. He blogs at reDesign and Tweets @rakeshlobster. Groupon is currently in a quiet period in relation with its planned IPO.
Groupon’s amended S-1 IPO filing is out. The revised filing tamps down some of the enthusiastic tone of the original and highlights a number of risks, several of which were covered in TechCrunch’s in-depth series on daily deals.
Potential investors looking for good news will be disappointed—I didn’t see anything in the document that would lead me to believe the business is any better than I’ve written before.
Among the highlights:
Controversial accounting metric de-emphasized. Groupon’s filings use a non-standard metric called Adjusted Consolidated Segment Operating Income. To arrive at this, Groupon takes the revenue generated by a deal and subtracts only the money paid to the merchant. Significant costs like subscriber acquisition, marketing and sales are ignored. I describe it as “the best possible way to view our business if you took out all of the things that make it look terrible.” The revised S-1 walks back its importance. “We believe Adjusted CSOI is an important measure of the performance of our business” has been revised to “We believe Adjusted CSOI is an important measure for management to evaluate the performance of our business.” Later, it says, “We do not view Adjusted CSOI as a valuation metric.”
Gift card laws and compliance. In the revised S-1, Groupon states “Groupons generally are included within the definition of “gift cards” in many of these laws,” an issue I reported on previously. Groupon updates the risk section to include the possibility that Groupon or merchants may in some states be on the hook for the full value (including promotional discount) of the Groupon for years or indefinitely. Unlike retailers who issue gift cards, Groupon does not record Groupon issuance as a liability. (Technically, Groupon considers itself a marketing agent and the Groupon is really issued by the merchant.) This presents a significant risk for investors. Further, many merchants use Groupons as an introductory promotion to build a book of business; if they become aware that they may be on the hook for Groupons indefinitely, there is an increased likelihood that they won’t issue Groupons. “In addition, we have received inquiries from the attorneys general of various states regarding the operation of our business under state laws.” Connecticut’s attorney general is among them.
Calling out impact of international growth. Much of Groupon’s revenue growth has been the result of international expansion, not organic growth in existing markets. “The increase in our revenue, key operating metrics and employee headcount from 2009 to 2010 is partially attributable to these acquisitions and the subsequent growth of our International segment as a result of such acquisitions.” International growth is also very important to Groupon for cash flow. In the U.S. and Canada, Groupon pays businesses within 60 days of the Groupon run. Elsewhere, merchants are paid as Groupons are redeemed. As a result, Groupon can hold on to that cash much longer. Groupons gross margins are higher internationally and Groupon also benefits from unredeemed Groupons. (In the U.S. and Canada, the merchant benefits.)
National deals. Groupon specifically acknowledges that national deals are offered at lower margins. “Gross profit is influenced by the mix of national and local deals we offer. We tend to accept lower gross profit margins for national deals because such offers are made, in part, for the purpose of acquiring new subscribers and establishing our brand.”
Deal mix. The revised S-1 shows the deal types split between North America and International and the results are very different. For example, food and drink was 29% of deals in North America and 19% internationally. Retail was 16% in North America and 4% internationally. The data are reported in an opaque way making deeper analysis difficult. But food and drink and retail are the toughest categories for merchants to make profitable using Groupons. But they’re also the categories that sell the best.
No longer “wildy profitable”. Groupon says that a Bloomberg report that Groupon co-founder and Executive Chairman Lefkofsky said  “Groupon was going to be wildly profitable” does not “accurately or completely” reflect his views. (Bloomberg stands by its story.)
Employees. In less than 45 days, the company has grown from “over 7,000 employees” to “over 9,000 employees”.
General softening. Several sentences were added softening the S-1. “We had net income of $21,000 for the second quarter of 2009 as compared to a net loss of $102.7 million for the first quarter of 2011. ” The data was already in the S-1 before, it has just been made more obvious. Another addition: “As a result of our limited operating history in a new industry and because the majority of our subscribers registered for our service or made their initial purchase of a Groupon in the past 12 months, it is difficult to discern meaningful or established trends with respect to the purchase activity of our subscribers or customers. ” A letter from Andrew Mason has been moved from the front of the S-1 to page 32 and now says, “As with any business in a 30-month-old industry, success for our investors is not guaranteed. We have yet to reach sustained profitability and we have no shortage of competition. Our path will include some moments of brilliance and others of sheer stupidity.”
A whole lot of beans to count. Starbucks chief Howard Schultz will make $200,000 a year and get 60,000 stock options for serving on Groupon’s board.
Despite all of these changes, the S-1 doesn’t address the things I most want to know. There are a number of key metrics that should be known to the company that I’d want insight on before investing:
Email subscriptions and open rates. What is the trend in email open rates? Are emails being opened more or less frequently? A decline in email open rates would indicate deal fatigue on the part of consumers or a decline in deal quality for consumers. The rapid growth in subscriptions can also hide the people who have dropped out. What is the unsubscription rate? Companies like Netflix report churn and it would be useful to have the data here.
Fraud and refund rates. The S-1 makes scant references to fraud and refunds, though it does show reserves of about 4% of revenue for refunds. Given their generous refund policies and a strong focus on small businesses, this can present a significant risk to investors. Small businesses are subject to failure and Groupon’s expensive merchant terms result in a big risk of adverse selection. To date, Groupon has refunded money to consumers who have had difficulty redeeming vouchers.
What proportion of their subscription list was “bought” and hasn’t returned. Just like small businesses who use Groupons to draw customers in with amazing prices, daily deal providers occasionally subsidize deals for customer acquisition. Deals for things like Amazon gift cards and movie tickets are often subsidized by the deal providers. This can work as long as those customers continue to purchase. But if they don’t make further purchases, it’s just a loss. Those deals are also expensive because it’s virtually guaranteed that existing customers will buy them.
Subscriber and customer acquisition costs and their trends. These are critical metrics to understand whether Groupon can be profitable in the long term. If customers can’t be acquired for less than their value, that’s a problem. I would expect that these costs go up over time as the low-hanging fruit has already been picked. The S-1 mentions that high acquisition costs are a concern but doesn’t directly provide them.  Doing the math based on other numbers provided, I estimate the cost of a list subscriber at $6.40 and the cost of an actual purchaser at $26.50. That’s a big number for a business with few barriers to entry. For Netflix, this number is $18.03—but Netflix has a subscription business with recurring revenue.
Revenue by deal type. Groupon runs deals across a wide range of categories. For some businesses, the underlying economics work. For others, they don’t work. If most of the revenue is coming from restaurant deals, that would raise serious red flags. If revenue is predominantly from events, that’s a good sign. (Some of this can be estimated from external sources, but it would be good to have validated data.) The revised S-1 has charts that shows breakdown of types, but it doesn’t provide revenue.
Voucher redemption rates. These are going to be imperfect due to poor tracking technology. But for businesses that are doing online tracking, it would be useful to have the data. It could be used to estimate any potential risk if states hold Groupon responsible for compliance with gift card laws.
Proportion of deals purchased by high volume customers. Groupon is selling businesses on the value proposition of customer acquisition—that all they have to do is show off how great they are and customers will come back. But if deals are primarily purchased by deal seekers, it may not really be in the business’ control whether they come back. Over time, businesses would stop running Groupons if they knew that they had no shot at converting a customer. Cheapskates are not good acquisition targets for most businesses. (Except for Groupon and its many clones.)
A statement on risk management practices. In North America, Groupon is essentially in the factoring business. Credit risk management is important to being successful. Take on too much credit risk and the company could face a lot of problems. As far as I have been able to determine, the daily deal companies are not sufficiently vetting credit risk.
Split between national/regional and local deals. National merchants will likely provide a lower share of revenue to Groupon than local merchants and will generally be more sophisticated about the structure of the offer. A higher portion of national merchants will results in margin compression (the amended S-1 notes that national deals do indeed have lower margins). The trend line on this split is also important. My observations indicate that deals are trending more national.
Of course, no company will provide all of these things. But an informed investor might want to ask these questions before buying the stock or projecting Groupon’s current growth forward indefinitely.

It’s that special time of the season, when Apple fans and investors alike get to gloat over just how much money the tech giant in Cupertino is raking in: Quarterly Earnings. The company had a blockbuster Q1 — will it be able to continue its winning streak?
Apple just pushed its press release detailing the stats for this quarter. It reports $24.67B in revenue and $6.40 EPS, beating the street  consensus  of an Earnings Per Share of $5.36 on $23.34 billion in sales. Apple’s (typically conservative) guidance was $22.00 billion in sales and a $4.90 EPS.
Apple bested expectations for its iPhone and Mac sales, which were around 16.25M and 3.6M units respectively. But the iPad tally is underwhelming (analysts were looking for 6.3M sales). Apple may explain the weaker sales during its earnings call — it’s possible this is related to the fact that some customers waited for the impending release of the iPad 2, which is still routinely out of stock at Apple stores. iPod sales continue to decline as the product is overtaken by iOS devices (though Apple still sold 9.02 million iPods).
Apple’s earnings call will begin at 2PM PST. We’ll be updating this post with more once the call begins.
2:03M PST – The call is beginning. Apple CEO Steve Jobs (who is on medical leave) was not announced at the beginning of the call. Sounds like CFO Peter Oppenheimer and COO Tim Cook will be leading the call.
Q&A
(note: there are a couple answers that we didn’t catch)
Q: Comment on supply chain disruption from earthquake in Japan.
Tim Cook: Japan in general… It’s an incredible tragedy. Apple has a history and ties with people in Japan. Regarding business, had some rev. impact Q2, but wasn’t material… expecting 200M less in Q3 which is reflected in guidance. Not expecting supply or cost impact. We source hundreds of items from Japan — the earthquake and tsunami and nuclear crisis caused disruption for suppliers. But Apple employees have been working around the clock with supplier partners in Japan, have number of contingency plans. Partners in Japan have displayed “incredible resilience”.  Do not anticipate any material impact to component/cost in Q3, but situation remains uncertain. Difficult to predict whether issues will impact rev beyond Q3.
Cook: Demand on iPad 2 has been staggering. Heavily backlogged. Extremely pleased with progress of manufacturing rollout. Adding 13 more countries next week… will produce very large number of them for the quarter.
Q: Color on what drove iPhone strength in the quarter?
A: We did well everywhere on iPhone. In US grew 155% year over year. Adding Verizon was key. AT&T did extremely well during the quarter. Continued to be on a tear in China.
A: iPhone 3GS for $50 “did very very well”.
Q: LTE phones — how do you think about maturity of those networks, Apple’s sense of urgency there?
A: Was asked when launched iPhone with Verizon. I still think this is the case today: “The first genration of LTE chipsets force a lot of design compromising with the handsets and some of those we are just not willing to make. We are extremely happy with the iPhone 4 and iPhone 3GS.
A: Several international countries are very portable focused (laptops). See popularity in both iMac and portable, believe great future for both..
A: iPad seems to be creating halo effect for the Mac. 28% Y/Y versus worldwide market of PC contracting 3%.. it’s astonishing.
Q: Regarding iPad constraints, when will channel inventory be where you need it?
A: Confident we’ll produce a “very large number” for the quarter. Whether it will be enough to meet the staggering demand, I don’t know.
Q: Can you talk about CDMA phone and markets you may go with that?
A: On carrier side, don’t want to get into specifics about CDMA or GSM.. but we are constantly looking at where we can bring on incremental partners. Brought on 3 large ones this quarter.
Q: Similarities between Android and Mac/PC rise…?
A: Comscore reported iOS outreaches Android by 59% in US. We’re gaining traction in enterprise. “what appear to be fewer than 100” apps on Android. We’ve paid over $2 billion to developers; 10 billion downloads. Business proposition is very strong. We believe Apple’s integrated system is the way to go.. compared to Android’s
multiple OSs on multiple devices with different screen resolutions and multiple app stores. “Turns customers into systems integrators”.
Cook: Going to use what was learned in China to expand to other markets. I think considerably more than half of China is prepaid. I think the first digit is a 9 there.
Q:How closely had Steve stayed with decision decisions?
Still on medical leave. Still see him on a regular basis, he continues to be involved in major strategic decisions. I know he wants to be back full time as soon as he can.
Aren’t giving out breakdown of iPad vs iPad 2. K-12 is more conservative than enterprise than adopting new technology. Last quarter 1:1 ratio of iPad to Mac.
Q: Historically have done iPhone in June, iPod Sept.
A: We never comment on unannounced products. By end of quarter in supply/demand balance for iPhone in almost all markets. Today think we are in supply/demand balance everywhere. iPad 2 has the mother of all backlogs now though.
A: Won’t give out number for new iPhone users vs people buying a second/third etc. iPhone.
A: We don’t typically buy in spot market. Beyond Q3, it’s tough to see that far. But feel very good for Q3.
A:iPad today is subsidized in a few markets — Korea, Japan, couple European countries. But vast majority of people using iPad on 3G do so on pay-as-you-go plan. Carriers can do that but many customers prepare pay-as-you-go.
Q: Hard for us to comment on gross margin changes Y/Y.
A: We are Samsung’s largest customer, they’re a very valued component supplier to us. I expect the relationship to continue. We felt the mobile communications division had crossed the line. Tried to work it out, but decided they had to rely on the courts.
Here’s an excerpt of the press release:
Apple® today announced financial results for its fiscal 2011 second quarter ended March 26, 2011. The Company posted record second quarter revenue of $24.67 billion and record second quarter net profit of $5.99 billion, or $6.40 per diluted share. These results compare to revenue of $13.50 billion and net quarterly profit of $3.07 billion, or $3.33 per diluted share, in the year-ago quarter. Gross margin was 41.4 percent compared to 41.7 percent in the year-ago quarter. International sales accounted for 59 percent of the quarter’s revenue.
Apple sold 3.76 million Macs during the quarter, a 28 percent unit increase over the year-ago quarter. The Company sold 18.65 million iPhones in the quarter, representing 113 percent unit growth over the year-ago quarter. Apple sold 9.02 million iPods during the quarter, representing a 17 percent unit decline from the year-ago quarter. The Company also sold 4.69 million iPads during the quarter.
“With quarterly revenue growth of 83 percent and profit growth of 95 percent, we’re firing on all cylinders,” said Steve Jobs, Apple’s CEO. “We will continue to innovate on all fronts throughout the remainder of the year.”
“We are extremely pleased with our record March quarter revenue and earnings and cash flow from operations of over $6.2 billion,” said Peter Oppenheimer, Apple’s CFO. “Looking ahead to the third fiscal quarter of 2011, we expect revenue of about $23 billion and we expect diluted earnings per share of about $5.03.”

Editor’s Note: This is a guest post by Mark Suster (@msuster) a VC at GRP Partners. He blogs at BothSidesoftheTable
There’s a line of thinking in Silicon Valley that you should build product businesses rather than services businesses. This thinking is largely driven by the venture capital industry (and subsequently Wall Street) who are in search of high margin, highly scalable businesses.
It’s nearly impossible to get a services company financed by VCs. You’re a small fish.
So pervasive has this thinking become that on several occasions startup companies with profitable & fast growing tech services businesses have come to me wanting to change their companies to product businesses or to create “spin outs.”
A great recent example of this was a successful group of entrepreneurs who had created a company that will do $10-12 million in revenue at their system integration business in 2011 ($5 million in 2010, $2-3 million in 2009). They feel very confident they can hit $18 – 20 million in 2012.
They have created two internal technology “products” and wanted to figure out how they could turn their services business into a product business that could be financed. This team is talented. They wanted advice. And probably some money.
I gave them advice I don’t think they were expecting from a VC,
“Don’t raise venture capital for this business. Ever. And stop effing around trying to create a product company.”
It is advice I give entrepreneurs often as I have written here on why most businesses should never raise VC.
Why Shouldn’t Most Services Businesses Raise VC?
Well, let’s look at this exact situation:
Why Build a Services Business in the First Place?
There are at least two types of tech services businesses in my mind:
1. Service as a bridge to a product business – One of the best ways for young startups to finance their business without any dilution is what I call “customer financing,” which is mostly only possible in businesses that target businesses rather than consumers. Customer financing often comes in the form of your company agreeing to build a product with a “sponsor” customer or two and helping them with the rollout / implementation. Often in this strategy you end up giving them the product for free and bill them only services fees. You own the IP you create.
The benefits for the customer are: a mostly custom-built product addressing one of their internal needs, the focus of a very talented young startup focusing on their business need & free product – potentially for life.
The benefits for you are even more clear: you get to build a product raising significantly less external money (if any at all) and therefore no dilution, you get a customer who will help you figure out the real requirements for your business and you have your first real reference client lined up, which should help with future funding and with future sales.
If you set out to build this kind of business you just need to be sure you don’t become a permanent consulting business by default. The “customer-financed” type of tech service business is never frowned upon by VCs – unless you’ve been doing it for 2-3 years with no product business to show for it, by which point they assume you’re the second type of services business.
2. Services for services sake – The type of business that is generally shunned in Silicon Valley is the “pure services” business like consulting, system integration, value-added resellers (VARs), customer support businesses, outsourcing companies, etc.  I have already outlined some of the economic reasons these can be good businesses as well as the one of the most important – retaining full control in you business.
But the broader reason that I often suggest to entrepreneurs is that they’re much easier to build than product businesses even though they’ll never become Google, Twitter or Facebook. Trust me – it is far easier to persuade a business to pay you for your services (a concept they readily understand) than it is to persuade them to buy a totally new product concept and pay for that product.
“How much is that software really worth? Who else is using it? How much did they pay? Wait, I’m only paying “X” for my Salesforce.com licenses – and you want me to pay “Y” for your product? Who are your competitors – how much do they charge?”
I could go on-and-on with all of the sales-blocking messages you will hear when you try to charge for a product. I’ll repeat: everybody understands paying for services. It’s pure irony. At my first company we would have a product sale of $80,000 where the customer would grind us to get the fee down to $70,000 but would readily pay $25,000 extra for “implementation & post-sales support.”
We were building a VC backed software business so I had to focus on the product business. But this lesson in business was never lost on me. And some of my former teammates are now building really awesome services businesses in the exact same field and they own 100% of their companies.
Even tech blogs know this. You struggle to get advertisers to pay your CPM rates and get your page clicks up in a business where you become a near commodity to every other website out there. Yet you can run a conference and mint money. If it’s well run, people readily pay for conferences and sponsors readily pay to become platinum, gold or silver sponsors. Tech blogs can theoretically scale, tech conferences are pure service businesses.
But How Do Service Businesses Grow?
I’m not saying the scaling a services business is easy – it’s not. One big challenge is how to grow the company. You end up needing to add staff and take on more risk without knowing what your future demand will be. There are a couple of ways to think about this growth.
1. Start with a network of independent contractors (1099’s)- When you’re a young company with 3-4 people and you land work that requires 7-8 it can be daunting. You don’t necessarily want to take on the extra employees and risks. I recommend that you establish a network of contractors who want to do similar work to you but don’t know how to sell projects or to build a company. They’ll be glad for the occasional extra work.
2. Vendor financing – When you start to win business – let’s say as an implementation arm for tech / business products or as an ad sales team for large tech / media businesses – you can often get financed in a small way by your vendors who are all to happy to have a bigger ecosystem of implementation houses. They won’t do this before you prove yourself but once you hit a minimum scale this is always an option.
3. Angel financing – just because VCs won’t back this kind of business doesn’t mean angels won’t. If you can show a few million in sales and the ability to return dividends in the near-term there are always smart businesses professionals who will consider financing this. What are there other choices these days – money in a bank at 0.5% interest?
4. Bank financing – OK, so this isn’t immediately likely to come from Wells Fargo, but there are tech banks like Silicon Valley Bank or Square1 Bank that are in the business of financing startups. If you can show regular cashflow and are willing to put your profits into their bank you can often fund expansion this way.
Final message on financing – just be careful not to let your fixed costs get too high as a young services business. In a booming tech market like 2011 it’s easy to think your business will always expand. The problem with service businesses is that when the economy turns revenue & profits take a really big and quick hit. Those companies that have a largely variable cost base and make the tough decisions survive for the next boom.
Why Shouldn’t Service Businesses Become Product Businesses?
If you build a true “technology services for services sake” business at some point you’ll likely build technology products as part of your projects where you either own the IP or you own in jointly with your customer or business partner.
This is where many service businesses make mistakes and go pear shaped. They get “product business envy” because they read too much TechCrunch about their product brethren raising money at crazy valuations and getting sold at even crazier ones. So they set out to build a product business within a services company.
A few problems arise. Firstly, they don’t realize how hard product businesses are. They mistake their successes in selling services as a competency in selling products. This is a huge mistake. Secondly, they often ramp up their cost base to accommodate these costs, which when a down market hits they are more effed than those that stay focused. Finally, the focus on the product (envy) means that they take their eye off of their core business, which is services. So the core business suffers.
I saw this first hand. My first career was at Andersen Consulting (one of the largest services businesses in the world). We built a hugely successful global services business yet we never got over our product envy from watching our tech clients. So we created internal software projects and all of the internal consultants on those projects became blowhards who thought they knew how to create software product businesses.
We stunk at every product we ever created. We had no sense for gathering real customer requirements. We over-spec’d products. We built for our over-intellectual selves. I can’t think of any great software tools ever created internally by Andersen Consulting. We were a great services business. Period.
What Should Services Businesses do with Their Product Businesses?
So back to my advice to the company I recently spoke to about spinning out their tech business or raising VC. My advice wasn’t to shut down all product / IP initiatives but rather to be clear on their purpose and how to monetize them.
1. Products as a service sales machine – My dear friend Franck Meudec in Paris knows this best. He has built some internal technology products to support his services business. They are “loss leaders” for his core business. Instead of going in and trying to hold the line on how much to charge for these products he can tell customers, “Sure, we’ll give you our planning software at cost if you decide to work with us.”
His business is booming. These products help him win his core sales. He is not confused about which is the horse & which is the cart. He is building a services business. Instead of owning 1% in options to join a startup tech company he created his own tech services business. He is the majority owner. Higher risk, higher reward than joining as a junior employee somewhere else.
2. Products as a key differentiator – Another important reason for having internal IP in your services business is as a key differentiator against other services businesses. If a customer is faced with two equal choices for companies who can implement Salesforce.com – how do they choose one other than references & price? Imagine if you had built a few modules on top of Salesforce.com that made that product more effective? Even if you didn’t charge for these it would sure increase your sales hit rate.
Tech services business in booming markets are mostly about how fast you can sell, implement, manage quality, hire and sell some more. In a down market IP can become a huge differentiator.
3. Products as a gross margin bump – Finally, it should be said that in a services business often your implementation rate becomes a commodity relative to others in the market. If you can make an extra 10% on each sale by selling your “add on” products that are at 90% gross margins not only will you increase your win rates but you’ll also add valuable profits to your bottom line.
In summary: I’m not advocating that companies are crazy to try and be product companies. In fact, that’s all that I fund as a VC. But I don’t want the narrow world of venture-backed companies and the trade rags that report on them to dissuade the overwhelming masses of potential entrepreneurs from building meaningful businesses that are both fun and economically rewarding.

Apple has just announced their Q4 2011 earnings. As expected, they’re big — but unlike the last several quarters where Apple has destroyed the number expected by the Street, Apple actually fell short of those expectations this time.
How short? Well, even though Apple’s own guidance for the quarter was $25 billion in revenue, analysts seem to have wised up to Apple’s always-low estimates and were projecting numbers far higher: they were looking for around $29.5 billion. Apple came in at $28.27 billion. That’s still their second best quarter ever — just shy of last quarter’s record $28.5 billion quarter — but it is below the Street.
So why the miss? Well, the main reason is likely the iPhone. Sales dipped over 3 million compared to last quarter. This is undoubtedly because the world was awaiting the next version, the iPhone 4S, which launched last week. Though that device sold 4 million units in just three days, those numbers will count towards next quarter. Apple sold 17.07 million iPhones in the quarter, which is 21 percent growth year-over-year, but again, 3 million less than the 20+ million iPhones Apple sold in their record previous quarter. The iPhone is Apple’s biggest source of revenue.
But it wasn’t all bad news for Apple. The company did manage to beat the Street’s expectations for the iPad. Apple sold 11.12 million in Q4, which was ahead of the 10 million or so expected. Apple also sold 4.89 million Macs in the quarter — a new record for the company. This was also above what some analysts were hoping for.
iPods sales continue to fall. Apple sold 6.62 million in the quarter, which is down 27 percent year-over-year.
Apple’s earnings-per-share (EPS) were $7.05. Apple’s EPS guidance for Q4 had been $5.50, but again, the Street was aiming higher, looking for around $7.30 EPS.
Apple’s quarterly net profit was $6.62 billion, down a bit from last quarter, but up over $2.3 billion from a year ago. Gross margin was 40.3 percent, up from 36.9 percent a year ago.
Interestingly enough, Apple says that international sales now account for 63 percent of overall revenue.
Since this was Apple’s Q4 and end of their fiscal year, the company also announced a new milestone: the first $100+ billion year in terms of revenue. The total came in at $108 billion, with profits coming in at $26 billion.
Apple gained $5.4 billion in cash for the quarter. Guidance for next quarter is $37 billion — which is massive — and an EPS of $9.30. Again, Apple is always low in estimating these, so next quarter, the holiday quarter, may not only be Apple’s first $30 billion quarter. It may be their first $40 billion quarter.
Update: After Their Miss, Apple Predicts Record iPhone, iPad Sales And Hints At A $40 Billion Quarter
Apple’s earning call live notes (paraphrased):
Tim Cook, Apple CEO:
This is our first earnings call since the passing of Steve Jobs. An amazing human being. A great leader and mentor. His spirit will forever be the foundation of Apple. We’ll continue his amazing work. Only Apple can do the integrations we do. Moving forward we have “relentless focus”. I’d like to thank everyone for the support in the time of Steve’s passing.
Peter Oppenheimer, Apple CFO:
Record September quarter for us. Huge Mac and iPad sales, records. Record iPhone quarter for us too.
4.89 million Macs, a new record — ahead of last quarter.
Portables make up 74% of Mac mix. But desktop sales
OS X Lion response has been tremendous — 6 million downloads in the quarter.
6.6 million iPods. Down year over year, but ahead of our expectations. iPod touch is over half of the sales.
iPod share is still over 70% in the U.S.
iTunes Store near 1.5 billion. Over 16 billion songs downloaded. iBookstore also popular.
17.1 million iPhones. Very strong in Asia Pacific. We prepared for transition to iPhone 4S.
We expected this with “rumors” out there. iPhone sales did decline — especially the second half of the quarter.
iPhone seeing great corporation deployment.
We’re extremely enthusiastic about Siri.
We’re shipping iPhone 4S in seven countries right now. 22 more countries by the end of this month.
New record for iPad — 11.1 million in the quarter.
iPad 2 now in 90 countries.
iPad revenue was $6.9 billion.
Been since 18 months since we introduced iPad. 92% of Fortune 500 now testing or deploying iPad.
Airlines love iPads.
25 million iOS devices sold last quarter.
iOS 5 is great.
iCloud has had a great launch so far. We believe it’s the easiest way for customers to manage content.
App Store has over 500K apps and 18 billion downloads. It’s now in 33 more countries. 123 countries now.
$3.6 billion from Apple Stores. iPhone sales were down in stores because of the iPhone 4 launch a year ago.
First store in Hong Kong now. 5 other China stores are the highest trafficked stores.
357 stores now.
77.5 million visitors in September quarter.
Looking ahead: about 40 new stores. 3/4 outside the U.S. Replacing higher volume store primarily in the U.S.
40.3% margin. Lower component costs.
$81.6 billion in cash now. Daaaamn. Some of it was spent on Nortel patents and legal agreements.
Once every six years we add a week to fiscal quarter — we’re doing that next quarter.
Guidance: $37 billion for next quarter. Massive.
$108 billion in revenue for the fiscal year. A huge increase over last year.
Almost $26 billion in profit for the year — that’s growing even faster than revenue.
==============Q&A====================
Q: iPhone 4S was launched so close to holiday time. Are you ready?
TC: We’ve gotten off to a great start — 4 million in 3 days. We’re confident that we’ll have a large supply. But I don’t want to predict when it might balance. I’m confident, we’ll set an all-time record for iPhones this quarter.
Q: Last quarter there was a problem with the sell through?
TC: The sequential comparison was down, but it was much less than what we were expecting. That’s why our revenue exceeded our guidance. We thought it would be more — we knew there was great anticipation of a June or July new iPhone because we had done that the past few years. But it wasn’t as bad as we thought. The reduction happened largely in the back half of the quarter as speculation hit “extreme highs”. But iPhone 4S is out there now. So is iOS 5 and iCloud. We’re confident in a record next quarter. The iPhone 4S start is better than our wildest dreams.
Q: 40% gross margin — why can’t you do better next quarter?
PO: The new price points for iPods will change some of that. Other price points as well fluctuating.
Q: What about China?
TC: Progress has been amazing. 2% of total Apple revenue in ’09, this year just ended it was 12%. This last quarter it was 16%. “It is growing at a feverish pace.” We have 6 stores now in greater China. The online store isn’t even a year old there. Over 7,000 point of sales on the iPhone in greater China. I’ve never seen a country with as many people rising into the middle class aspiring to buy products that Apple makes. It has quickly become #2 on our list of top revenue countries. Other areas are key too: Brazil (up 118% year over year), Russia (looks more and more promising), the Middle East. Several of these markets that Apple hasn’t been strong in, but the iPhone changes that.
Q: Talk about the strength of manufacturing.
TC: I think we have an outstanding team in this area. A track record that’s unparalleled in this industry. We are diversifying some. But our approach is to do business with as few people as we can so we can be very deep with them.
Q: Amazon is coming with the Kindle Fire with a lower price point. Weigh in on that?
TC: We had an outstanding quarter with record iPad sales — and at the same time a Mac record, which is phenomenal. Several competitors have come to market over time, some had different form factors, different price points, none of these have gained any traction thus far. In fact, our share went up. In the June quarter IDC says we are responsible for 3 out of every 4 tablets sold. iOS 5, iCloud, iTunes, etc — I feel very, very confident about our ability to compete. And extremely confident in our product pipeline.
Q: Deferral of iPhone for new carriers?
PO: We opted to defer adding new carriers or countries in the September quarter knowing the iPhone 4S would come in October month. So we waited. Biggest impact were the rumors that were very pervasive.
Q: Size of tablet market?
TC: We thought it would be a huge market. And it has been even greater than we thought. We’ve sold 40 million cumulative now. I still believe it will be larger than the PC market.
Q: Talk more abou the iPhone. How many units were deferred?
TC: You can’t run the experiment twice, we can’t tell you how many we would have sold without rumors. But I certainly believe it was substantial. That’s why we called it out. I think if you’ll talk to the customers, you’ll get the same kind of answer. The iPhone 4S opportunity is huge. Again 4 million sales in 3 days — the mother of all uplifts. We’re thrilled with how we’ve gotten started. I couldn’t be more pleased with where we are.
Q: iPad in next quarter?
PO: We won’t provide thoughts yet for March, but next quarter we expect company records for both iPad and iPhone. For Macs we expect to outgrow the market for 23rd consecutive quarter.
Q: How do you see Siri? A feature or a key way to interact?
TC: The number of people using it already is amazing. The questions and personality is also incredible. We see this as a profound innovation. Over time many, many people will use it as a substantial way. Hard to know the percentages of how they’ll use it. But it’s substantial.
Q: Supply chain thoughts?
TC: Our hearts go out to all the people in Thailand who have lost lives and property during monsoons. We get multiple components from Thailand. There are several factories that are not operable. The weather hasn’t allowed an ability to look at that. The primary exposure is on the Mac for this.
Q: Comment on patent disputes — specifically with Samsung on Android?
TC: Don’t want to comment on litigation. But as you know we spend a lot of time and money and resources on coming up with incredible innovation. We don’t like it when someone else takes those. Unfortunately we’ve been pushed into the court system as a remedy to that.
Q: Price reduction on iPhone 3GS offering?
TC: We wanted to make the iPhone more accessible to a broader market. 3GS is now free on a post-paid basis in many markets. But we lowered the price of the iPhone 4 to $99. These are still fantastic products and we think we can do reasonably well selling those in the post-paid market. And the advantage of lower price in the pre-paid market — not free and $99, but lower.
Q: More general view of supply demand and pricing into next quarter? Unibody?
TC: We treat every concern we hear about our suppliers very seriously. We’re investigating. We factored that into the numbers given earlier. The general market — we see pricing to continue at favorable levels.
Q: Will there be pressure on gross margins with the lower priced products?
PO: About 40% next quarter in terms of margins. Quite strong. Looking forward we will continue to offer the best products to customers that we can. We’ll be innovative and aggressive.
Q: On iPad where are we on full roll-out?
TC: About 40K points of sale around the world. 50K for iPod. 120K on iPhones right now. There was no slow down in iPad numbers. We’re now in a supply/demand balance.
Q: What about the other growth markets?
TC: The basic approach is the same as the gameplan we used in China.
Q: Now you’re CEO, any thoughts on strategy with the cash?
TC: We’ve wanted to maintain flexibility. It’s not burning a hole in our pocket. We’re not doing silly things with it. We’ve done things in our best interests. We’ve acquired companies, some IP, invest in the supply chain, and use money to build out our stores. I believe what we’re doing with the cash is great. That said, I’m not religious about holding cash and not holding it. We’ll continue to ask ourselves what’s in Apple’s best interest? It’s a topic for the board ongoing.
PO: Remember that $54B of our $81B is offshore too.
Q: The tablet market bigger than PC market — what about cannibalization?
TC: I do believe we’re seeing cannibalization. Some people are electing to buy an iPad rather than a Mac. But I believe a larger number are electing to buy an iPad instead of a Windows-based PC. We’re coming out well. The Mac had it’s best quarter by far ever last quarter. That was during the best iPad quarter. That’s unbelievable. With cannibalization like this, I hope it continues.
Q: Is buying back shares with your cash perhaps kind of a white flag that you can’t create value through innovation anymore?
TC: I think anyone looking at our track record wouldn’t say we’re waving a white flag. We have a pipeline that’s unbelievable. I view buying back shares to be separate. The cash is always a topic, it’s always about what in our best interest.
Q: You blew through initial iPhone goal. Do you have a similar goal going forward?
TC: We want the iPhone to be in as many customers hands as possible — we think it’s the greatest phone by far. That’s why we live to do that. We aspire to higher volumes. We think the smartphone market will swallow the broader handset market. It’s still a tiny part.
Q: Is the extra week for the quarter truly linear?
PO: The 14th week will conclude on New Year’s Eve day — a good week for us. We’ll provide details on our January call in terms of what we saw. Expenses will be up a bit. But fixed costs will be fixed.
Q: On Japan — in terms of year over year, there was some discrepancy in revenue.
TC: A huge percentage of Japan’s total revenue in the year ago was the iPhone 4 launch. So when you do year over year compare, that affects the revenue compare. But Mac grew hugely in Japan this past quarter.
Q: Longer term iPad opportunity — is there more opportunity to go down market or up market?
TC: I dont’ want to get into what we might do — that answer would do that. We see the tablet market as a huge market. We could not be happier with our position in it. We have some fantastic things in the pipeline. 40 million in the first 18 months — I think we have a fairly good handle on what to do next.
Q: Lower price point on iPhone in emerging market?
TC: In some market we dropped the 3GS price a bit early. It was very good and led to some of what we did last month.
That’s a wrap.

Intel has released their Q3 financials, and for the most part it’s good news for their investors. Their revenue (GAAP) was a record $14.2bn, up $3.1bn from last year’s Q3. Gross margin is down by 2.6%, but net and operating income are both up quite a deal, $3.5bn (16%) and $4.8bn (17%) respectively. Their CFO reports that it was their most profitable quarter ever.
The source of this prosperity is, according to intel, “double-digit growth in notebook PCs” and “strength in the data center fueled by the ongoing growth of mobile and cloud computing.”
The PC Client group saw a 22% increase in revenue to $9.4bn, attributable to the growth in notebook PCs, many of which sported Intel’s new Sandy Bridge Core processors. Their biggest competitor in this space, AMD, only last week released their response to Sandy Bridge, and in addition to being late to market it is reported to be under-performing compared to Intel’s line. So growth in this area is likely to continue unabated for the time being, apart from erosion of the PC market by tablets, phones, etc.
Intel’s Data Center Group is up $2.5 billion in revenue, a 15% increase, though competition here is likely greater and margins smaller per processor. The field itself is growing quickly, however, and for every smartphone Intel isn’t powering, there’s a new server they are powering.
But all is not well in Santa Clara: their Atom group is down 32% to $269mn, a tiny fraction of what it was during the netbook rush of 2009 and 2010. And of course no data is reported for mobile chipsets (other than wireless chips for WiMax and so on), because Intel has almost literally no presence in that sector. CEO Paul Otellini has said on the record, however, that they intend to bring x86 to phones in 2012. Whether that’s part of their intended $4.3bn in R&D spending isn’t clear — and anyway, that wouldn’t include the cost of the sweetheart deals they’d have to cut with handset makers.
One little piece of trivia: they’ve added around 3400 employees this quarter, bringing them to almost exactly 100,000. Congratulations to Intel on this milestone.
The rest of the results, along with commentary and extra information, can be found here at Intel’s Investor Relations page.

Apple has had a rough couple of days. Yesterday, CEO Steve Jobs announced a medical leave of absence. As a result, the stock plunged today before rallying back to close down just over 2 percent. But this should cheer everyone up. Apple has just announced their Q1 2011 (their holiday quarter) earnings — and as many anticipated, they’re massive.
How massive? Well, coming off its best quarter ever in terms of revenue ($20.34 billion in Q4), Apple was projecting $23 billion in revenue for the quarter. The Street, meanwhile, recognizing that Apple always lowballs these numbers, thought revenue would be more like $24.38 billion. The actual number? $26.74 billion.
Earnings per share had been pegged at $5.38 by the street (well ahead of Apple’s $4.80 estimate). The actual number there was $6.43. Net quarterly profit, meanwhile, was $6 billion — well above the record $4.3 billion Apple did last quarter.
In terms of actual products, Apple sold 16.24 million iPhones, a new record for the company. Perhaps more impressively, they sold 7.33 million iPads — over 3 million more than last quarter.
Apple also sold 4.13 million Macs and 19.45 million iPods during the quarter. The Mac sales were also a new record and were up 23 percent year-over-year (though a little below what some had been projecting). iPod sales, meanwhile, were down 7 percent year-over-year, continuing their decline.
Gross margins also continued their trend of being slightly off what they were in the year-ago period. This quarter they were 38.5 percent versus 40.9 percent a year ago. This likely has a lot to do with how well the iPad is selling — a device which Apple priced fairly low compared to their normal margins.
Jobs as quoted in the release on the numbers saying, “We had a phenomenal holiday quarter with record Mac, iPhone and iPad sales. We are firing on all cylinders and we’ve got some exciting things in the pipeline for this year including iPhone 4 on Verizon which customers can’t wait to get their hands on.”
Apple is projecting $22 billion and earnings per share of $4.90 for the upcoming quarter.

Below, find my live notes from the earnings call:
Peter Oppenheimer, Apple CFO
Q&A with CFO Peter Oppenheimer, COO Tim Cook, and Treasurer Jerry Whistler
Q: How do you make sure you have enough iPhones?
TC: As I mentioned last quarter, we made a very bold bet on taking iPhone capacity to 14 million. Previously it was in the 8-ish range. In the past quarter it was now over 16 million. We’re working on increasing this further. But it takes time. We’re thrilled to be coming to Verizon. We’re going to do everything possible to get the iPhone into as many hands as possible.
Q: Mac App Store — best selling apps tend to be Apple-made ones. Any initial thoughts?
TC: It’s just getting going. But we’re thrilled with the million sales in such a short amount of time.
Q: How comfortable are you with the availability of iPhones and iPads? Shortages?
TC: On iPad, we increased dramatically last quarter — we expanded in number of countries. We’ve be over 60 countries soon. We feel good. With iPhone 4, I also feel good, but it’s not enough. We do still have a significant backlog. We’re working around the clock to build more. I feel great that demand is so high. But I can’t predict when supply will meet it. We think Verizon will be huge.
Q: What about Asia Pacific growth?
TC: Of Brazil, Russia, India, China — we several years ago targeted China as our top country. The numbers have been staggering. It’s mainland China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan. $2.6 billion from that area alone (up 4x from the prior year quarter). Korea has also been a very good market for us. iPhone and iPad are big there. Several other Asian countries doing very well. Japan by itself, the revenue is up 80% year over year. That’s stunning. We’re placing more and more resources in these areas.
Q: Long-term business planning. How far out do you guys plan? Product roadmap?
TC: That’s a part of the magic of Apple. I don’t want anyone to know our magic, so they don’t copy it. In my view, Apple is doing its best work ever. We’re all very happy with the product pipeline. Steve has driven this. “Excellence has become a habit.” We’ve done outstanding in our Mac business — 19 quarters straight of growing faster than the market. But we still have a low share. There’s still huge opportunity there. We have a low share in the handset market too. Huge opportunity there too. And incredible momentum there. iPad just got started — it’s a new category. Almost 15 million sold so far. I don’t know what to predict. We believe it’s a huge market. We’re in some great markets. We feel very confident.
Q: How many more iPhones could you have sold?
PO: You can’t run the experiment both ways. We couldn’t make enough. We would love to make more.
Q: Can you talk about what components were better in terms of price last quarter? What about next quarter?
TC: We expect favorable pricing for DRAM next quarter. Some prices for raw material is increasing due to the worldwide economy getting better. For other commodities, we expect things to fall in pricing as they normally do. Last quarter, we saw a favorable pricing trend. That helped us.
Q: Which component areas are you making investments in?
TC: I don’t want to give that out. I don’t want the competition knowing. We design components where we believe we can innovate — like the A4 chip.
Q: Is there something about the iPad going forward that would make it hard for margins to rise?
TC: Margins consist of a number of factors. You can’t really take on product and speak about it in accurate terms. We’re confident in the guidance.
PO: We shipped a lot of iPads last quarter and margin is pretty good.
Q: What about iPad competitors?
TC: There’s not much out there as you know. There are two kinds of groups today (in the market) — the ones using a Windows-based operating system. They’re big, heavy and expensive. Weak battery life. Need keyboard or stylus. From our point of view, customers aren’t interested in that. Then you have the Android tablets. The variety shipping today, the OS wasn’t designed for a tablet — but Google said this. So you wind up having the size of a tablet that’s less than reasonable. Or one that’s not even a real tablet experience. It’s a “scaled-up smartphone” – that’s a bizarre product in our view. Those are what is shipping today. If you do a side-by-side with an iPad, some enormous percentage are going to pick the iPad. We have no concern there. In terms of next generation. There’s nothing shipping yet. So I don’t know. “Today they’re vapor.” However, we’re not sitting still. We have a huge first-mover advantage. And a huge user advantage from iTunes to the App Store. Huge number of apps and an ecosystem. We’re very confident entering into a fight with anyone.
Q: Move to iPhone non-exclusivity has had no impact on ASP. Will that be the same in the U.S.? More CDMA carriers?
TC: I don’t anticipate the ASP decreasing, no. In terms of other carriers, we’re always looking. When we move from exclusive carrier to dual carrier, overall, our growth has changed and our market share has increased. That doesn’t mean in every country, it’s all different. We’re thrilled to be working with the Verizon team. We’re also happy about the multi-year non-exclusive deal with AT&T still.
Q: Why only one carrier in China?
TC: We always are looking at opportunities to grow. But remember we are constrained on iPhone 4.
Q: Can you give updated thoughts on the Mac side? And what about the upside of the iPad and cannibalization.
TC: What we saw in the Mac was 23% growth — we grew almost 8 times the market rate of growth. Every region outgrew the market, led by Asia-Pacific. That was up almost 10 times the market. We did significantly better than the market in all the major regions. Was there an cannibalization? “Honestly, I don’t know for sure. But yes, I think there is some cannibalization.” But I also think there’s a halo effect. It’s what we saw with the iPod and iPhone. “If this is cannibalization, it feels pretty good.” If our products do cannibalize the PC market, remember we have a low share still. So the other guys lose a lot more. We don’t worry about it here. The iPad team works on making their product the best. Same with the Mac. Both teams think they can continue to grow.
Q: What about different teams sharing ideas?
TC: Part of the magic of Apple is that there aren’t high walls among product groups. If one has a great idea, it gets spread around. With the iPad, people love instant on. So the MacBook Air incorporated that. That’s just one example, but there are plenty. It can start on the iPhone, the iPad, etc. I think Steve said it great — if the Mac company and the iPad company were separate, what would the Mac company build to compete with the iPad? The MacBook Air, I think.
Q: Do you have data on new people to the brand buying iPads?
TC: Of course we have that data. For iPhone, the number looks different because we’ve been shipping it for a while. iPad is now moving mainstream. That data needs to settle a bit still. We’re introducing a lot of people to Apple that haven’t been with us before.
Q: What about revenue outlook? Will Verizon help?
PO: We’re working hard to increase supply of iPhones, but it will take some time. In terms of sequential guidance, we’ll still be up huge year over year. We usually have declines after the holiday season though. We’re not sure about iPad though. We’ll see. The iPad was clearly a hot holiday item.
Q: Last call, Steve had a lot to say about Android. Any other observations?
TC: If you look at the iPhone portion, we had record sales — 16.2 million units in the quarter. We believe we could have sold more if we had more supply. We grew faster than the market. We’re continuing to expand countries and carriers. We’re getting big enterprise traction. We have the highest customer satisfaction ratings. Biggest App Store. Over 160 million iOS devices now. This is huge. We believe our integrated approach delivers a better experience over the fragmented approach. Look at the number of App Stores out there. People are going to “pull their hair out”. If you see who is on the latest OS, you’ll see we’re always way ahead (was Cook reading TechCrunch this morning?)
Q: What about future products?
PO: Sorry, we don’t talk about future products.
Q: What about the MacBook Air? How do you look at that?
TC: The way that we look at it is that it’s a phenomenal part of our growth of the Mac last quarter. The customers love it. We’re really happy with how it’s doing as a starting block. But we’ve only been shipping it for 90 days. We’re just getting going.
Q: What about the consumerization of enterprise technology? The iPhone and iPad at work.
TC: This is one of the “megatrends” going on. It’s more about employees doing what works than everyone using the same thing. You can run your whole business off of an iPad or iPhone. This was unimaginable just a few months ago. The potential is huge. The numbers are already incredible. The iPad only started shipping in April. We already have 80% of the largest companies trying it out at least. Generally enterprise is much slower, much more cautious. But to their credit, they’re seeing it. With iOS, we’ve been focusing on enterprise for a while. It’s paying off. There’s a huge play here for us.
That’s a wrap.

A lot of Americans desperately want to believe that China is full of poor people who can’t innovate, and the only goods they make are cheap, toxic rip-offs our Western brands. They want to believe the only reason the Chinese economy is surging is because the West wants cheap goods and China knows how to make them that way.
These people will hate this post because it’s about a company called Greenbox that flies in the face of those preconceived notions.
Greenbox makes high-end, super-styled kids clothes in and for the Chinese market. It caught the eye of Disney, which reached out to the company to ask if it wanted to manufacture some of their lines. “No thanks,” the company replied. “We’re not interested in just being an OEM.”
Wait, isn’t this China we’re talking about? It’s a country of OEMs.
The mouse house came back with a sweeter offer that’s being announced at a ceremony in China tonight: It has licensed the rights for the princess collection, Mickey Mouse and Minnie Mouse and Winnie the Pooh to Greenbox. The company will design a high-end online collection to be sold online in China, as part of a broad plan to help build hype for the upcoming themepark in Shanghai.
Greenbox was founded more than ten years ago by a designer named Fangfang Wu who started to make clothes for her kids because she was so unhappy with the cheap, boring ones being sold in the country at the time. She obsessed over fabrics, fashion and design and a hobby quickly turned into a business, as she opened a chain of stores, and later closed those stores to sell on Taobao for better margins.
She was one of the top grossing sellers on Taobao as her designs struck a chord as with other young, working women in China who wanted to flaunt their increasingly hip and unique tastes. (I mean, look at that outfit above. It’s like a little Chinese Natalie Wood playing Red Riding Hood. How is that not adorable?) In 2010, DCM’s China office sought her out, investing just over $10 million to help scale the business.
Today Greenbox is bringing in about $50 million in annual revenues on decent margins. She charges between $30-$40 for items— not absurd, but certainly on the higher end for kids’ clothes. “It’s a classic case for venture capital: High gross margins, but takes money to build it to scale,” says Hurst Lin of DCM.
Note I didn’t describe Greenbox as the fill-in-the-blank of China. In fact, I’m hard-pressed to come up with an ecommerce model she’s ripping off from the US. Kids clothes hasn’t been a natural vertical for etailers here, save being an offshoot of a site like Amazon.
The reason Greenbox has worked so well for China is cultural. Because there are so many only children, there are at least six people wanting to lavish them with cute things: The parents, and two sets of grandparents. This was the same insight Tencent tapped into to monetize its virtual goods early on.
So, Greenbox: Not a copy cat, and not the invisible cheap assembly partner for the West either. Welcome to the next stage of Chinese entrepreneurship.
Greenbox is part of a crop of booming ecommerce companies in China. For years, the market has been held back due to the typical challenges of shipping, infrastructure and payment platforms. Jack Ma, of Alibaba, has long said ecommerce would be bigger in China than here, and that’s not just because there are more people. In the US, he calls ecommerce “dessert,” but in China there are so many people underserved by brick-and-mortar retail that ecommerce will be the “main course.”
DCM and other firms have been aggressive backing many new ecommerce players, and they aren’t as simple as just being the Amazon of China. (Although, to be fair, DCM backed one of those too.) Many of these companies, like Greenbox, show a sophistication in appealing to what the Chinese market wants, not simply what’s worked elsewhere.
A surprising vertical Lin seized upon that has never proved lucrative in the US is wine. As incomes soar, many Chinese are developing a taste for Western wine, but have trouble finding interesting vintages and even navigating the language barriers, he says. His bet, YesMyWine, isn’t just an ecommerce play, it’s a content and media play.
He was delighted the PR contact on the call brought up another hot DCM ecommerce company: La Miu, which makes sexy lingerie. I could hear him squirming as he tried to explain– delicately– why Victoria’s Secret failed miserably in China, while more recently La Miu has succeeded.
Victoria’s Secret tried to market to women in their 30s who wanted to be comfortable not sexy. It was a bit too early in China’s consumer revolution and husbands weren’t demanding sexier underwear so ever-practical Chinese women just didn’t see the appeal.
Victoria’s Secret made another mistake that Lin tries to explain as tactfully as possible: Asian women have… different bodies….than Western women.
But La Miu has taken a totally different tact: Marketing underwear designed for the Asian body type to teens. “Born in the late 1990s they are much more a global consumer, they are open-minded and more rebellious,” Lin says. “It’s been a huge success.”
As I’ve written before, China’s ability to be the assembly line to the world wasn’t where its role in the global economy ended; it was where it began. An ability to make products cheaper than anywhere else gave way to an ability to make high end products more nimbly than anywhere else. And increasingly, entrepreneurs like Wu are adding design and brand on top of that to create products the broader world will want.
The first generation of Chinese entrepreneurs was about picking the low-hanging fruit in a massive country just opening up to capitalism. Now the real fun is starting.

Founded in 1972 by Nolan Bushnell and Ted Dabney, Atari played a central role in the early history of video games, going on to create what are still some of the most recognizable arcade games on the planet, like Centipede, Breakout and Pong, to name a few. Not to mention the fact that its joystick-controlled Atari 2600 console was pretty much synonymous with “video games” in the 1980s.
Although Atari remains a recognizable brand around the globe, the company struggled through the video games crash of 1983, financial issues, and various assets have fallen under a number of different ownership and leadership regimes, including Warner Communications and Hasbro — among many others.
Today, Atari is a 65-person company, with headquarters in New York and France. The company looks a lot different than it did two decades ago, but the current leadership team is focused on leveraging Atari’s assets, its strong brand recognition and global distribution, to reinvent it as a mobile and social games company. 
But doing so is no easy task. EA, one of the largest and most recognizable video games companies, also has the benefit of strong brand recognition and a number of successful and popular titles, like Battlefield, Need for Speed, Mass Effect, FIFA and Madden, to name a few. EA has recognized that it can’t hope to compete with the likes of Zynga simply by remaining a console company and pumping out sequels to popular titles. Over the last few years, EA has gotten busy porting its flagship games into social and mobile channels. Of course, even that’s not enough. (More here.)
As Atari CEO Jim Wilson said, the key to success for any company is creating quality, original products. “There’s no other way to maintain long-term viability”, he said. “Atari can’t rest on its laurels, we have to stay relevant”. 
In refocusing on mobile and social as the two-headed future of gaming, Atari released “Greatest Hits” for iOS back in April, which is an 18-title sample course of Atari’s classic games. Earlier this month, Atari launched Greatest Hits on Android. And two weeks ago, the company brought its Asteroids franchise to iOS, tailoring the retro game for a new medium.
Asteroids: Gunner became a top ten bestseller on the App Store for its first two weeks, and Greatest Hits has racked up over 3.5 million downloads across platforms since its release in April. So, the veteran games company has found some success in moving its classic games to mobile, just as EA and others had found before it. 
On December 8th, Atari will continue its release of its classic games on mobile, as it will launch “Breakout: Boost”, an amped-up version of the 1976 arcade classic, on iOS. The game will include the traditional five levels, along with 200 additional levels of brick-breaking that can be unlocked through in-app purchases. 

Breakout will also see new control features that allow gamers to change ball speed to ramp up the difficulty, as well as power-ups, “Grenade Balls” (and ball upgrades), brick varieties, the ability to save progress, and OpenFeint and Game Center integration.
To back up the retooling of its games for mobile devices, Atari has also made some additions to its executive leadership, including the recent hiring of Gui Karyo, a gaming and entertainment industry veteran, as EVP of Development & Operations. Karyo has previously held senior executive positions at Mindspark, Majesco, and Marvel and has taken over day-to-day oversight of the company’s product development, operations, and Atari.com in an effort to accelerate the development of its mobile and online strategies.
Leadership with prior experience in social and mobile game development and restructuring business processes and products around these growing channels is key as Atari goes after a new freemium, microtransaction-driven rebranding. Atari has miles to go before it can ever compete with the bigs in social gaming, but as a relatively lean company, it may have an easier time transitioning into the mobile and casual game space than some other heavier companies that have come before it.
Of course, leadership is only the start. To build a successful modern mobile gaming company, Atari has to internally become a company comprised of developers, engineers, and designers that specialize in mobile. They’re on their way, and the Atari CEO says that the company is constructing initiatives that will increase outreach to the developer community to drum up interest around modernizing Atari’s games.
Atari is happily the owner and/or manager of an extensive library of more than 200 games and franchises that include brands like Centipede, Missile Command, Pong, Test Drive, Backyard Sports, and Deer Hunter. Moving forward, Wilson says that the company is looking to evolve these games for a new generation of gamers — updating their look — while maintaining gameplay identity.
But more important will be launching, new original titles. Atari can coast on its brand and classic arcade games and probably continue to cash in on brand recognition, retooling its games for any and all new channels that manifest over the years. But without creating new, relevant products, Atari’s reinvention as a mobile company will really only be skin deep.
And looking at Atari’s current financials, it seems that this reinvention as a mobile and digital operation is now a must. The company’s digital revenue (for the first half of the year) comprised 63.6 percent of its total net revenue — compared to 20.1 percent in the first half of last year. Digital revenues were $10.5 million in the first half of the year, an increase of $6.3 million over the prior year. This has led the company to cut its operating loss to about $2.6 million, a 61.2 percent improvement over the same period last year.
Revenues are still low, but focusing on fewer and more profitable games has helped the company see improvement in its gross margin; and while ramping up its spend on R&D and marketing for its new digital games has contributed to lower numbers, Wilson and team are hoping that these kind of investments can help push its mobile transition forward.
To that end, the CEO also said the company is currently hiring, and is now going after “the best and brightest” to help steer its new mobile/social trajectory. If the company can learn from Zynga’s metrics-driven approach to customer retention, while baking freemium, location, and social elements into their new titles, Atari could be poised to lift itself out of replay mode.

I’m not often the fan of startups that are “the this, for that,” but I think I could get into something like Deal Décor: it’s the Groupon for furniture. This San Francisco-based startup is using the group-buying model made popular by Groupon to connect customers with factory-direct deals from overseas furniture manufacturers.
The company is launching on Monday in San Francisco, which will serve as the pilot program for the service for 6 months. Afterwards, the plan is to launch in one new city every month, scaling up to reach the 20 largest metro areas in the U.S.
Although consumers might not realize it, Deal Décor isn’t exactly a direct rip of the Groupon model. Where Groupon uses group-buying to promote coupons, Deal Décor uses group-buying to get better prices on furniture orders from manufacturers. Savings range anywhere from 30% to 70%, the company says.
A closer competitor would be something like home goods-focused flash sales site One Kings Lane, or others in the space like Gilt Groupe or Ideeli. But those sites are offering steep discounts on high margin retail items, they’re not getting factory-direct deals.
The first deal being offered to San Francisco shoppers is a 3-piece sectional sofa that comes from Vietnam. Here it is on EverythingFurniture.com for $949. Amazon has it here for $706. Walmart lists it at $829. Deal Décor’s price? $399. Items are selected through the founders’ relationships with factories – they find out the top-selling items, and tack on their extra volume to the end of the production run, which keeps costs down.

Further discounts are possible, too, because typical gross margins for furniture retailers tend to run 50% (sometimes even 100%) over wholesale pricing. But because Deal Décor is purchasing directly from the manufacturers, not the importer or wholesaler, its gross margins can be lower. As is its overhead. However, its net margins are closer to what furniture retailers make.
In addition to Vietnam, the company’s founders, Craig Sakuma and Gregory Lok, have built up a network of over 100 factories in Asia, including China, Malaysia and Indonesia.  The network was developed over the past decade or so through their experience at furniture retailers and companies like Home Depot, Target, Home Decorators Collection, William Sonoma and Hamilton Spill Furniture Group, where they worked in management, consulting and hands-on roles throughout the supply chain.
Of course, with Deal Décor, you might not have the plethora of options that a furniture retail store would offer in terms of customizations to the furniture itself, value-added services like leather or fabrication protection, in-store warranties, financing options and more.
But like some brick-and-mortars, Deal Décor operates locally, allowing the company to able to handle customer deliveries and returns locally, too. In San Francisco, the company partnered with a third-party logistics firm (also a FedEx partner), to handle warehousing, delivery and customer notifications. On top of the sofa’s purchase price, customers pay $6 to pick it up at the warehouse or $33 for home delivery. Deal Décor says it’s not making delivery a profit center for the business, though.
For those wanting to see the sofa in real life first, it will be on display in local venues like the Treasure Island Flea Market, for example. The same model involving third-party logistics and local venues for showcasing the items will be used as Deal Décor moves into other regions. (To see if Deal Décor is coming to your area in the future, check out the sign up form at the bottom of the company homepage.)
Eventually, the company hopes to offer more than one item at a time on its website per region, so there’s always a bedroom, dining and living room item available at all times.
Deal Décor is funded by Sakuma and Lok at present, but is in talks with several Bay area VCs and angels.

If you’re still in shock over the prices you actually paid for your iPhone then you should steer clear of this story. It could send you to the emergency room. Teardown firm, Portelligent, estimates that the cost of materials for the 4GB model is $200 and $220 for the 8GB model. These estimates don’t include the final build, but Apple has historically seen gross margins of 50 percent, so these estimates are probably not too far off. As if you didn’t know, the touch-screen was the most expensive component at $60 per unit. These figures make me sick to my stomach, but I didn’t buy one and 50 percent margins aren’t that out of the ordinary, either.

My dad is an inveterate pack-rat and when I was home this weekend I was going through a copy of Bon Appetit from 2001. Don’t ask me why. On the back page was an ad for the Handspring Visor. It showed the Visor in four configurations — phone, black and white camera, MP3 player, and I think GPS. Each of these features required a separate piece of hardware along with some software. Seeing these four Palm-powered devices made me tear up a little. I believe I was still using a Palm V back then, adding and deleting contacts with abandon and scribbling my calendar on the Palm V’s dark screen. Palm — and Palm OS — wasn’t just a trademark back then. It was part of the zeitgeist. It was part of our culture.
That, sadly, is no longer the case.

Companies that were once part of the cultural landscape either fade away or flame-out spectacularly. IBM is one of the fade-outs and I think Microsoft is next in line. But Palm went from king of the world to also-ran in a blink of an eye. In the interim they’ve maintained a 10-year-old product, the Treo, and even older OS and over-promised and under-delivered for years. This, friends, is the last year of Palm.
I love Treo and Palm OS. I used to program for it back in the day and considered it a very elegant solution to the thorny problem of creating a smartphone with a usable operating system. Look at Windows Mobile — the Redmond giant couldn’t even create something that worked smoothly and without issues yet a scrappy little group of programmers made one of the most popular smartphone operating systems in the world.
But its day — and Palm’s hour — has passed. With the Foleo sunk and Palm hemmoraging money, things are looking grim. Even their move to WinMo and their new Centro won’t pull them out of this hole. For example, CNBC reported today:
The company will report earnings Tuesday, but we already know the news will be bleak, thanks to a pre-announcement a couple of weeks ago that the company would miss its topline expectations by $30 million; its gross margins have been killed.
This is getting ugly, but it’s leading to a lot of speculation that Palm’s days as a public company may be slipping through the hour-glass. There’s a growing sentiment in the Silicon Valley that Palm may go private; that this was the plan all along and that such a plan is getting far more affordable for the team at Elevation.
So if Palm goes away what happens to the universe of 3rd party apps and the user base? I suspect Palm will be subsumed by a larger company and the OS phased out. The hardware design is still very popular and fairly usable but the OS is definitely showing its age and with a potentially uber-cool WinMo 7 coming up, Palm will  have quite a bit of catch-up.
What should Palm do to save itself? It should pull an OS X out of its hat. Take the Linux core, create a killer UI, and have HTC make cool new Treo. The icons we know an love that populate that start screen need to go away. Palm can still win against Symbian — albeit only in the U.S. — and if they don’t amaze us with a full overhaul, they’re dead.
If this doesn’t happen, Palm is finished. I know you like your Treo and I like Treos as well, but this market is too large and too expensive to dabble in. Sybmian has the might of Nokia behind it and WinMo has the might of millions of installed Windows PCs. Apple has a cool factor and Linux and Android, bless their hearts, aren’t even in the race. RIM has business locked up, leaving what for Palm? Sodoku fans?
I might have to eat my hat, but unless Palm stuffs fifty guys in a room with some coffee and danish and tells them to make iPhone 2.0, they’re screwed. If we’re still talking about Palm next year, I’ll be very happy and very surprised but this is not the same company that once held a generation of dot-commers rapt with awe. This is a dying company and only extreme measures — or extreme unction — can save it.

As my final act for the print edition of Business 2.0, I interviewed serial entrepreneur Bill Gross of Idealab.  Gross is best known for his Web 1.0 companies, especially GoTo.com/Overture and CitySearch, and eToys.  So he’s had his share of both successes and failures.
But if you look at his portfolio of startups today, other than the click-per-action search engine Snap.com, it is dominated by atoms businesses instead of bits businesses.  These include Energy Innovations, eSolar, Evolution Robotics, and Desktop Factory. I asked him, what made him shift his focus.  Excerpt:
Q. Why did you move away from pure Internet companies?
We started making only Internet companies because we felt this was an incredible new medium that had unbelievably high gross margins. If you could make a Web site, you could sell something online and you could make margins of 90 percent or higher. When we looked back at the ones that were most and least successful, we realized it had nothing to do with their margins. It had to do with how protectable the idea was. Was there a core intellectual property with which you could differentiate yourself and earn sustainable margins? Because you can make good margins online, but if you can’t sustain them, it doesn’t mean anything. 
So that led us to take another look at all businesses – even companies that make physical products. We had shied away from making anything with atoms; we were all caught up in doing only things with bits. But you can make things with atoms and still have a huge amount of intellectual property in them, where you can earn good margins and protectable margins.
That’s a lesson most Web 2.0 entrepreneurs have failed to grasp.  I guess that sometimes it takes a bust to learn these things.

BusinessWeek.com is running an article that breaks down how much all the parts inside the iPod nano end up costing and says that, "despite the addition of a video screen, the new nanos boast the widest margins yet for the line."

The sum-total of the parts contained within the $149 4GB nano comes to $58.85 and the $199 8GB nano’s parts cost $82.85. These figures come from iSuppli, whose "estimates don’t account for nonhardware costs, including software development, intellectual property, packaging, final assembly, and distribution."
Apple’s gross margin tends to hover around the 30%-to-%35 range, according to Shaw Wu of American Technology Research. So figure that after all the intangibles are paid for, Apple’s making around $50 on the 4GB version and around $65 on the 8GB version. 
Yeah, so there you have it. Try to keep from shaking your fist at Apple for turning a buck (or fifty). It tends to do an alright job at pricing things where supply, demand, and gear envy all intersect. I always take these "Apple’s making how much money offa me???" articles with a grain of salt. Chances are, you’re getting ripped off much worse in some other aspect of your day-to-day life — like the 8GB-nano-worth of gas you put in your car every month.

Nokia has just released its fiscal Q2 2012 financials. It’s reported €7.5 billion ($9.2 billion) in net sales, a slight increase from the €7.4 billion last quarter but a 19 percent drop on a year ago. Lumia sales are up to 4 million, and basic devices were also up to 73 million units. But it’s being done at a great cost: net sales are down by five percent, and the operating loss is almost twice the value it was last quarter: €826 million ($1.01 billion) compared to €487 million a year ago. Earnings per share are at -$0.09, failing to meet analyst guidance.
Analysts expected the company to report a loss per share of between $0.10 and $0.11, a drop of nearly 220 percent on the same quarter a year ago. Revenue estimates were $7.3 billion for the quarter, down slightly from the $7.4 billion reported for last quarter.
It’s disappointing, but it shouldn’t come as a surprise. In June, Nokia had issued an update on its guidance for the quarter to revise down expectations. It said it expected higher restructuring charges — €1.9 billion for the next two years — along with unprofitability in the devices unit with operating margins at more than negative three percent (before it had been a straight negative three percent).
Here are some of the numbers in today’s earnings:
Smartphones: Four million Lumia phones sold, in line with estimates. Overall 10.2 million devices sold, meaning that even now Symbian is still outselling the new Lumia range built on Microsoft’s Windows Phone. The total number sold is a decline both on last year (down 39 percent) and the last quarter (down 14 percent). The average selling price on the devices is up by a bit and is now at €151 ($185) but gross margins are getting hit hard: they are now just at 1.7 percent compared to 15.6 percent last quarter and 23 percent a year ago.
Net sales for devices — $5 billion (€4.023 billion) in total — are down by 26 percent on last year, but interestingly the U.S., where it only sold 600,000 devices in the quarter, is the only market where they have increased sales by value in the last year:

 
 
 
Feature phones, meanwhile, led by Nokia’s Asha range, the company has managed to hold up numbers much better. Its total sales there, $2.8 billion, is only down one percent on last year, and volumes have grown by two percent to 73.5 billion units.
Operating margins for the devices and services is now at -9.1 percent.
The company’s gross cash position is now at €9.4 billion ($11.5 billion) and net cash is at €4.2 billion (5.1 billion). The company is thought to be sitting on patents worth some 6 billion and may look to sell some of those to shore up its position going ahead through what look to be ongoing tough times.
Looking ahead to Q3, Nokia says that it expects operating margin to be the same as it is in Q2, “plus or minus four percentage points.” In what Nokia says will be a “challenging quarter” for smartphones “due to product transitions,” it cites ongoing competition in smartphones (namely Android and Apple very much dominating the landscape at the moment); consumer demand for Lumia products not strong enough and the general macroeconomic environment.
For a slightly heartbreaking backstory on a company that might have been looking to innovate too much before its time, and too slow to move with changes in the industry, check out this feature in the WSJ.
We’ll be covering the analyst call at 8am Eastern and will post highlights from that as it happens.

Apple has just released its fiscal Q3 2012 earnings, and the Cupertino-based company reported revenues of $35 billion (compared to $28.6 billion in the year-ago quarter and $39.2 billion in Q2 2012) and quarterly net profit of $8.8 billion (compared to $7.3 billion in the year-ago quarter and $11.6B in Q2 2012). All that breaks down to earnings of $9.32 per diluted share.
During the days leading up to the disappointing release, analysts expected to see Apple rake in revenues of about $37.4 billion, with earnings of roughly $10.38 per share. Apple also reported gross margins of 42.8% (compared to the impressive 47.4% figure the company revealed last quarter) and noted that a full 62% of the quarter’s revenues were thanks to international sales.
Apple also announced that the company would be issuing a cash dividend of $2.65 per share of common stock.
For what it’s worth, Apple managed to blew past their own forecasted expectations ($34 billion in revenues, with earnings of at least $8.68/share). That’s not much of a surprise though, as Apple has historically tended to low-ball its quarterly performance estimates. To continue that tradition, Apple CFO Peter Oppenheimer offered up yet another conservative forecast at the end of the release — according to him, Apple expects Q4 revenues of about $34 billion “and diluted earnings per share of about $7.65.”
Apple’s hardware sales contributed quite a bit to its performance this quarter, though one device in particular was picking up most of the steam. As rumors of a heavily-redesigned iPhone continue to swirl and consumers settle in for the wait, analysts also predicted that the company would report lower iPhone sales figures. Again, not much of a shock since Apple’s newest iPhone has been on the market for nearly a year now, but the consensus among analysts was that Apple would sell about 29 million iPhones.
It turns out that the number was indeed down compared to Apple’s strong first and second quarters — the company only reported 26 million iPhones sold. That said, Apple managed to move plenty of iPads over the past three months thanks to the introduction of the Retina-friendly model prior to beginning of the quarter and the accompanying price drop for the iPad 2. Estimates pegged the Cupertino company as selling roughly 15.7 million iPads, but Apple reported an impressive 17 million iPads sold.
Perhaps due to some (warranted) trepidation ahead of the release, Apple’s stock closed at $600.92 today, down 0.48% from when the market opened this morning. As usual, Apple will be holding a conference call to discuss its financial performance at 2:00 p.m. PT/5:00 p.m. ET. We’ll be live blogging the whole thing, so stay tuned for more as it happens.

Some M&A activity among those companies that work behind the scenes so that carriers can continue to deliver your apps, streamed music, phone calls and texts without a hitch: the network testing company Ixia has announced that it will be paying $160 million in cash to buy BreakingPoint Systems. BreakingPoint is a specialist in security testing for wireless and wireline networks, as well as attack analytics, with more than 34,000 examples of attacks, malware and exploits parsed in its library.
The move means that Ixia will be able to offer its carrier and large enterprise customers a fuller portfolio of services for network testing — but perhaps more importantly it is a sign of how the growth in mobile and fixed data networks — on the back of the smartphone and tablet boom — has led to a bigger focus on security threats, data breaches and privacy protection.
The deal comes on the heels of Ixia’s purchase of another network performance company, Anue Systems, in May for $145 million. Vic Alston, president and CEO of Ixia, would not comment on whether the company is continuing on its acquisitions sprees. “We will never say never, but our main priority at this point is to integrate Anue and BreakingPoint and focus on growth,” he told TechCrunch.
Ixia says the deal is expected to close this quarter (Q3) 2012, subject to customary closing conditions and approvals.
BreakingPoint has built a business that provides not only security monitoring services and hardware products, but also comprehensive analytics. Customers include government agencies and large enterprises as well as carriers. The company has been growing its business consistently over the last four quarters, with sales growing by over 40 percent in 2011 to $33.5 million, on a gross margin of 87 percent. Ixia expects 2012 to show another 40-percent in growth.
This should come as no surprise given the double whammy of strong data network growth, combined with what Verizon called in its Data Breach Investigations Report, the rise of the “megabreach” from hackers. In a study carried out with a number of government agencies, it found that 2011 was the worst-ever year for data breaches, and the frequency of them appears to be on the rise.
It’s a trend that has clearly motivated Ixia into action, too: no matter how well a network performs, it’s useless if it gets taken down by hackers:
“The current threat landscape is changing everything – from the way we conduct business, to how we protect data and secure infrastructures, to the ways we train cyber warriors,” said Vic Alston, Ixia’s president and chief executive officer, in a statement.
“This dynamic IT landscape is creating a growing demand for solutions that provide definitive and current insight into the resiliency of critical IT infrastructures and defences…By leveraging BreakingPoint with Ixia’s integrated portfolio of proven network test products, customers will have available to them an end-to-end solution to help ensure business continuity for enterprises and government organisations.”
For its part, Ixia is also seeing a small increase in its own business. The company’s estimated up revenues for Q2 to $87-89 million from $86-89 million previously. The company has been on a buying spree of sorts: it recently also bought another network performance player, Anue Systems, which is already adding $3-4 million to its quarterly sales.

Another major acquisition for Dell this morning. The company announced it’s buying enterprise management software maker Quest Software for $2.4 billion. Under the terms of the agreement, Dell will pay $28.00 per share, which beat out Insight Venture Partners’ bid of $25.75 per share. Quest’s assets, including its access management software, performance monitoring solutions, Windows Server management solutions, database management, and more, will now serve to strengthen Dell’s recently formed Software Group.
The group,  announced in February, is designed to enhance Dell’s solutions capabilities and help provide a new source of revenue as hardware sales decline. Dell hired John Swainson, formerly of IBM and CEO of CA, to serve as President of the Group. Since then, Dell has also acquired Wyse and SonicWALL. With Quest, the focus is on the data center side of the business.
Dell stated that the Quest acquisition will help it expand its software capabilities in “systems management, security, data protection and workspace management.” The company also cites a few key components from Quest Software’s family of solutions which held particular interest:
Quest’s software portfolio has generated $857 million in global revenue based on fiscal year 2011 results at gross margins of 86% and operating margins of 11%, Dell reported. It also has a 1,500-person strong software sales force and 1,300 software developers who will join Dell’s software group following the deal. Quest is based in Aliso Viejo, CA and has over 100,000 customers worldwide, including 87% of the Fortune  500. The company has a total of 3,850 employees in 60 offices in 23 countries.
The purchase served to end a bidding war that had lasted for several months, according to reports from sources at Bloomberg and others.

After disappointing post-IPO performances from Facebook, Groupon and Zynga, there’s been a clarion call from top investors like Union Square’s Fred Wilson, Y Combinator’s Paul Graham and Kleiner Perkins’ Mary Meeker for everyone to simmer down with valuations.
But from what we can tell, any adjustment is going to take several months. For the very hottest late-stage companies like Fab.com, growth investors don’t seem to be taking any heed from public market skepticism yet. I asked around about impact on different stages of the market and this is what I got:
Secondary Markets
This is tricky. In theory, you’d think that Twitter should be down by a proportional amount in private secondary markets given Facebook’s decline. But secondary markets can be so illiquid that it may take months before this is reflected in secondary market pricing (or ever, if the public market rebounds in the meantime).
For one, you can’t short shares. Plus, private exchanges like SecondMarket do everything with the consent of the company. If the company gives its blessing, they’ll arrange quarterly or annual sales of stock and the company has full control over who sees their financial data and how the offering is priced. I can’t imagine many companies in their right mind would be eager to do an offering right now. You’d think that the market would freeze.
But there have actually been two tenders on SecondMarket since the Facebook IPO, although SecondMarket couldn’t tell us which companies did them or what the prices were. One was for a gaming company and both offerings matched the prices arranged before Facebook’s debut. A third tender was signed this week and SecondMarket says that inquiries about arranging auctions have actually increased recently.
Twitter may also be able to grow into its valuation with improved revenues, even if the surrounding market performs poorly. The over-the-counter market doesn’t seem affected for the moment, but my sources on this are a little biased! “Twitter is still in play at $8 to 10 billion,” says one longtime shareholder, who says his broker is continuing to send him buying inquiries at that range, even post-Facebook IPO.
Twitter had been considering another share auction this summer on behalf of employees, according to a source who arranges sales of stock for privately-held companies. It will be interesting if they move forward or not. A private share auction last year valued the company at $7.7 billion. They didn’t respond to a request for comment on this.
The other thing to note is that the muppets who lost money on pre-IPO Facebook shares were the ones who bought them after the company filed its S-1 and shared its financials. Facebook’s last trade on SecondMarket before the company filed in February was $31.50, and its four-year average was $28.50 when factoring in stock splits, according to the company. That’s really close to the $27.10 price Facebook is trading at right now. Only in the months right before the IPO did Facebook shares climb to a peak of $42.72.
Maybe it was a panicky, “train is leaving” effect where buyers rushed in. So don’t get emotional. You’ll get burned.
Late-Stage Fundraising
Fab, Spotify and Square are all on the market raising at valuations that top a billion dollars. We hear that Fab is oversubscribed on a $120 million round with a lot of competition for the deal. We said earlier they were raising $100 million. Fab said this week that they’re on track to do $140 million in sales this year. One late-stage venture investor tells us all of the good, companies are still getting bid up “like insane.”
Square is still out there. They haven’t settled on a lead investor but they may come in at $2.5 or $3 billion instead of $4 billion, we’re hearing from multiple sources. But the pricing matches what was discussed prior to the Facebook IPO, so there is not really an effect here either. Square didn’t comment on this.
Spotify may be in more of a difficult position. The company says it has 3 million paid subscribers. A back-of-the-envelope calculation gets you to about $450 million in annualized subscription revenue assuming an average $12.50 monthly rate (although exchange rates screw with this). Then there’s ad revenue too. A source familiar with the company’s financials tells us Spotify has a 30 percent gross margin, but when you factor in sales, marketing, administrative and development costs, they go into the red. If an institutional investor were to go in on them at a $4 billion valuation, they would have to believe that the company has a chance of eventually being worth $12 billion or more.
There are institutional investors who have been burned by the last wave of growth rounds. So they may be more reluctant to participate this time around. T. Rowe Price is in the red on Zynga after investing in February 2011 at $14.03 a share. Zynga now trades at $6.05. Late-stage Groupon investors are also close to a world of pain. Investors who went in right before the IPO put nearly $1 billion into the company at the equivalent of $7.90 a share. Groupon’s now at $10.70.
“You can’t be comfortable at 1.3X,” an earlier venture investor in Groupon said. “Like Icarus, they got too close to the sun.”
But overall, the top companies seem to be unaffected for now. If a company is profitable and has growth that would make a hockey stick jealous, there shouldn’t be a problem. It’s the companies that fall just short of this that will feel downward pressure. It’s the same dynamic as in overall venture market. Even though the total amount of capital allocated toward the VC industry has shrunk over the last 10 years, the very best funds continue to do well.
The best companies might even do better in a down market. There will be fewer me-too rivals backed by less savvy money and fewer companies stealing away the best talent.
Early-Stage
The impact on the early-stage market is the hardest to predict since these companies are valued more subjectively. Pricing in these rounds also matters a lot less to the bigger funds, because at the end of the day, if you truly believe you’ve found the next Facebook, who cares if it’s worth $20 or 30 million?
If you look at the market activity at this level before the Facebook IPO, aggressive seed stage valuations were a phenomenon that was largely limited to Y Combinator and a handful of other companies. For the vast majority of early-stage startups, fundraising has been challenging.
The e-mail warning that Paul Graham sent to Y Combinator companies this week was probably a necessary one — even without the Facebook IPO. There was a bit of investor angst (some merited, some not) over the last batch of YC companies. Basically, it was just very pricey with an average valuation cap of $10 million on convertible debt for a class of about 65 companies. That’s fantastic for founders, but it started to rub certain investors the wrong way. And this is an issue that has come up in conversation with investors from about a dozen firms, from early-stage to top-tier, over the last month.
One investor in Pair told me they were frustrated when they found out everyone else was allowed in on the round with different valuation caps. They said the company hadn’t been straightforward with them about this until there was a priced round. In the past, Graham has talked about offering different caps to different investors if they take more risk by investing first or add more value than others. He’s called this “high-resolution” fundraising. It makes sense. But the issue here wasn’t different caps. It was transparency. (To be fair, a different investor in Pair told me they were informed about the variable caps.) I’ve reached out to Pair and they haven’t responded yet.
Two other super-angels from two different funds said they were more conservative with investing in the last YC batch because of the valuations. Sequoia also didn’t invest in the last batch, but said they would consider doing follow-on funding later.
This is partly just natural market behavior. When things get super-hot, it’s smart to look elsewhere for less obvious opportunities. Another thing to consider is that the feeling might also be mutual as YC has its own private internal system where founders can review different investors. The ones that don’t get high marks may have a harder time participating in future batches. So maybe this is just sour grapes. It’s hard to say. I obviously wasn’t in any negotiations myself, but I just sensed a lot more tension this year compared to previous batches.
Even before the Facebook IPO, Graham and other Y Combinator partners like Harj Taggar had already been telling founders not to blindly pursue the highest valuations. They also encouraged founders not to take on too much convertible debt. Although pricing lower than your original cap isn’t technically a down round, it might be perceived that way.
Another YC founder, 42 Floors’ Jason Freedman warned founders to act respectfully toward investors because the market could quickly turn. Back in 2009, he said that no YC company could get more than a $3 million valuation right out of the gate. “Times are good now but the trough of sorrow awaits,” he said in a widely shared blog post.
“If your company blows it out of the water, you’ll be just fine no matter what,” he added. “But if you’re like the 80% of companies that are in the middle, then you run the risk of having a priced round down the line that is below the cap.”
The next Airbnb or Dropbox will be fine, but the future OMGPOPs of the world need breathing room and supportive investors before they find their homerun. Having too high a valuation or cap could prematurely doom them if and when the market turns. As Peter Thiel said in a recent lecture at his Stanford class, “Companies are essentially broken the day they have a down round.”
So the valuation issue was already an ongoing conversation that YC was having with its portfolio companies. The Facebook IPO was just a good catalyst for reinforcing it.
Lastly, for the love of God, it was never a bubble.
If the market settles down by the fall, that’s actually a good thing. Bubbles, which happen when prices get wildly misaligned with fundamental value, often end with an abrupt and extreme contraction — the kind with devastating socioeconomic impact. I may have nerded out on Kindleberger’s Manias, Panics and Crashes before the Facebook IPO — just in case! And historical bubbles from the 17th century to 2008 have all sorts of bizarre characteristics. They tend to include masses of normal, unsophisticated investors and draw out unscrupulous and fraudulent actors.
But it’s hard to see an abrupt contraction happening here. If Facebook’s shares stay at the same range for awhile, being 30 percent over-valued is not that big a deal. This isn’t Pets.com or even this clusterfuck of an IPO from the original tech bubble. The ecosystem can stomach it. There won’t be scores of laid-off engineers in bread lines by August (…. barring a disorderly exit by Greece from the EU, which triggers panic and contagion into the global banking system and maybe a crisis of confidence in government bond markets. Haha. Gulp.)
Macro-apocalyptic thinking aside, the long-term trend of technology becoming embedded into every facet of life and industry continues. Plenty of capital is still coming in too. The bigger firms are raising a billion dollars or more. Sequoia is raising $1 billion. Andreessen Horowitz just raised $1.5 billion. NEA is out raising a potential $2.5 billion.
Then there are about 10 or so early-stage funds that have either recently closed or are raising right progressively larger funds right now. Dave McClure’s 500 Startups just raised a $50 million fund while Felicis just closed $70 million. First Round just closed another $135 million. True Ventures closed $205 million. Kleiner Perkins’ Aileen Lee is also starting a $50 million fund. In an interview two weeks ago at TechCrunch Disrupt, Michael Arrington prodded David Lee into a non-denial that SV Angel was considering raising a bigger fund worth up to $400 million.
There is still plenty of capital around at multiple life stages. But it’s better to correct now, rather than later when it could become a really dangerous bubble. We’ll all be better off for it.

Two quarters ago, Apple unleashed Godzilla. It was a quarter so spectacular that the only appropriate way to describe it was in pure expletive form. $46 billion in revenue. $13 billion in profit. 37 million iPhones sold. 15 million iPads sold. A gross margin of 44 percent. These weren’t just good numbers, they were obscene.
That’s what made yesterday’s earnings release insane: Apple almost managed to match those numbers last quarter.
While pound-for-pound, Apple’s Q1 is the clear winner, I actually think Apple’s Q2 was more impressive. It was Apple’s Mothra.
In Q1, Apple was coming off a quarter that some considered “disappointing”. It was their first “miss” in forever. I put those terms in quotes because that’s where they belong. Those who actually knew what they were talking about with regard to Apple, knew that Q4 2011 was a fluke that happened for a few reasons — namely the launch of a new iPhone in Q1 rather than Q4 (in terms of Apple’s fiscal calendar, which is different from the ones human beings use). So it wasn’t hard to predict that Q1 was going to be big. Hell, Apple itself even hinted at it.
Of course, no one knew the quarter would end up being that good, but plenty of us were thinking big. But last quarter was more complicated. First of all, it was the quarter after the holiday quarter, which typically sees a good sized drop as buying slows. Second, because of an oddity in Apple’s fiscal calendar, Apple’s Q1 was actually a week longer than their quarters typically are. That means a week less of sales in Q2 compared to Q1. Third, the iPhone 4S was no longer brand new, so the pent-up demand was probably going to dissipate. Fourth, a new iPad was expected, but it wasn’t expected to be on sale until the end of the quarter, creating a sales void leading up to the launch. Fifth, there were no new Macs released in the quarter.
All of this seemed to be setting Apple up for a fairly significant drop quarter-to-quarter.
Nope.
Instead, what happened was that iPhone sales remained insane. 35 million for the quarter. While the phone grew its command of the smartphone market in the U.S. percentage-wise, the absolute sales numbers were down (again post-holiday and post-launch). But it was a different story in China. Because the phone was introduced in Q2 in that country, sales went through the roof. And it nearly offset the drop-off in the post-holiday and post-launch U.S. market.
Since the iPhone is Apple’s most important product revenue (and profit)-wise, this bolstered the overall numbers — especially with regard to profit (more on that in a bit).
Much was made yesterday about the iPad’s “miss” in terms of sales. Because Apple “only” sold 11.8 million of them, plenty of folks were disappointed. Those folks are idiots.
The new iPad only went on sale in the last two weeks of the quarter. But everyone knew it was coming. As a result, buying of the old iPad slowed in anticipation. This isn’t rocket science.
Further, Apple had trouble meeting demand for the new iPad in those two weeks on the books. If they can get the inventory up to speed, it will be this quarter which will be the big one for iPad. You release a new product, people buy more of them when they’re available. That’s generally how it works.
But again, this iPad dip did little to slow Apple’s quarter because of the iPhone sales. And more broadly, Apple’s overall business in China is booming. As Kim-Mai pointed out yesterday, Apple’s revenues for the quarter in China reached a record $7.9 billion, which was up threefold year-over-year. If you look at the graphs at the bottom of her post, you’ll see that Apple is becoming a much more global company. This means that their numbers are less susceptible to the ebbs and flows of the U.S. market.
But the most amazing number from Apple’s Q2 was 47.4. That was their gross margin for the quarter. It’s hard to describe how ridiculous that number is, but I’ll try.
In Q1 — again, the Godzilla quarter — Apple’s gross margin was 44.7 percent. It was so high that Apple CFO Peter Oppenheimer noted during the earnings call that the company didn’t expect to match such lofty levels ever again. Instead, they destroyed the number in Q2.
Why?
It was mainly because the iPhone made up an even larger percentage of overall revenue in Q2. The iPhone is Apple’s biggest money-maker and their product with the best margins, thanks largely to carrier subsidies (though more in the U.S. than other countries). The iPad also has great margins, but they’re significantly less (the iPad is not carrier subsidized anywhere). Less iPad sales (both in quantity and percentage-wise) and strong iPhone sales meant a higher margin. That’s why Apple’s revenue dipping $8 billion only equated to profit dipping less than $2 billion.
For some other margin context, look at this chart that Horace Dediu of Asymco put together. For the first time, Apple’s operating margin (different than gross margin, but just as important) surpassed that of both Google and even Microsoft. Apple is predominantly a hardware company. Google is predominantly an advertising company. Microsoft is predominantly a software company. This is not supposed to happen.
Going forward, those margin numbers almost have to drop. Not only will the iPad sales be big this quarter (again, the first full quarter the new iPad is on sale), but the $399 iPad 2 is apparently selling very well. That will drag margins down (but likely drive revenues up and make Apple less of an iPhone company).
The bigger questions will be if China sales continue on their torrid pace and if/when Apple finally gets around to releasing some new Macs.
While there is some confusion as to the timing of the next iPhone (due to the history of the launches), it seems pretty safe to assume that Apple will stick to the fall timeframe. Apple announced WWDC 2012 today, and while iOS was mentioned, it will probably be an iOS 6 developer reveal followed by a new iPhone in the fall again. This means iPhone sales should remain strong this quarter and will weaken in the following quarter leading up to a new device.
Apple is expecting revenues of $34 billion in Q3, which means they actually expect to destroy that number in Q3. I’ll probably have to come up with another Kaiju at that point.

Not great news for Nokia this morning in its ongoing attempt to reverse declines in its sales and market share in the world of mobile phones that it once easily dominated.
The company has announced it is lowering its outlook for the first and second quarters of this year, citing lower-than-expected sales in its devices and services segment. In a market statement today, Nokia did not specifically give any numbers on overall revenues but it said that operating margins in the first quarter are expected to be at negative three percent — down from earlier estimates of being either breakeven or within two percentage points of that; it also said that Q2 margins will be similar to or below Q1 levels.
As for the the silver lining, Nokia also noted that it has sold more than 2 million Windows Phone Lumia smartphones, with the average selling price at €220 ($262). There are now over 80,000 apps in the Windows Phone Marketplace app storefront, it added.
The financial revision come on the same day that the company launched a new NFC device, and one day after it said it would offer Lumia 900 customers credits on devices due to data faults on handsets.
 Q1. Nokia will be presenting full quarterly results on April 19. Today it noted that it estimates net sales in the devices & services segment in Q1 were €4.2 billion. Within that, feature phones brought in €2.3 billion (on 71 million units), smartphones €1.7 billion (on 12 million units), and all other services bringing in €0.2 billion. Nokia said that’s actually within the 4-6 week range it had provided earlier but also represents a decline on the previous quarter.
In the statement, Nokia does not give any guidance on Q2 revenues but highlights that it is seeing a lot of pressure in two specific areas: emerging markets — particularly India, the Middle East, Africa and China — as well as margin declines in the smart devices unit.
In a conference call, CEO Stephen Elop spelled out a bit more here, which hints at continuing margin pressures ahead as the company looks to continue to compete against lower cost Android devices and other cheap handsets from what Elop referred to as white-box Chinese manufacturers.
The pressures, Elop said, are at the low end of smartphones, and the high end of the feature phone markets — precisely where Android handset makers are being so aggressive in emerging markets. “We are taking the first step of pushing down the prices of Lumia devices with the 610,” he said. “And we are accelerating the rate at which we do that to compete better.”
He also noted that the continuing investments that are being made to develop its new business around Windows Phone comes at a price: “With this third ecosystem effort we have to really break through, with the U.S. and China just starting… you see a lot of things that [need to] build,” said Elop. “We need the right levels of investment to break through.”
Nokia and Microsoft’s efforts to break the stronghold that Apple’s iOS and Google’s Android have put on the smartphone market have yet to bear fruit. Figures from Gartner estimate the Windows Phone platform accounted for less than 2 percent of smartphone sales at the end of 2011.
The other question to ponder going into next week is where its legacy smartphone OS, Symbian, will be sitting in all of this and whether its Lumia strategy will be able to offset ongoing sales declines in that line of devices.
Full release below.
Nokia lowers Devices & Services first quarter 2012 outlook and provides second quarter 2012 outlook
Difficult financial performance reflects company in transition
Positive early momentum in Lumia smartphone strategy
Nokia Corporation
Stock exchange release
April 11, 2012 at 15.00 (CET+1)
Espoo, Finland – Nokia today provided preliminary information on certain aspects of its first quarter 2012 financial performance, including a lowered first quarter 2012 outlook for Devices & Services. During the first quarter 2012, multiple factors negatively affected Nokia’s Devices & Services business to a greater extent than previously expected. These factors included:
– Competitive industry dynamics, which negatively affected net sales in the Mobile Phones and Smart Devices business units, particularly in India, the Middle East and Africa and China; and
– Gross margin declines, particularly in the Smart Devices business unit.
The impact of these factors on the non-IFRS Devices & Services operating margin in the first quarter 2012 was partially offset by a significant benefit from lower warranty costs.
Updated outlook for Devices & Services for the first quarter 2012:
Nokia currently estimates that its non-IFRS Devices & Services operating margin in the first quarter 2012 was approximately negative 3 percent, compared to the previously expected range of “around breakeven, ranging either above or below by approximately 2 percentage points” primarily due to the factors noted above.
Outlook for Devices & Services for the second quarter 2012:
Nokia expects its non-IFRS Devices & Services operating margin in the second quarter 2012 to be similar to or below the first quarter 2012 level. This outlook reflects that the first quarter 2012 benefit related to lower warranty costs is expected to be non-recurring, as well as expectations regarding a number of factors including:
– competitive industry dynamics continuing to negatively affect the Smart Devices and Mobile Phones business units;
– timing, ramp-up, and consumer demand related to new products; and
– the macroeconomic environment.
“Our disappointing Devices & Services first quarter 2012 financial results and outlook for the second quarter 2012 illustrates that our Devices & Services business continues to be in the midst of transition,” said Stephen Elop, President and CEO of Nokia. “Within our Smart Devices business unit, we have established early momentum with Lumia, and we are increasing our investments in Lumia to achieve market success. Our operator and distributor partners are providing solid support for Windows Phone as a third ecosystem, as evidenced most recently by the launch of the Lumia 900 by AT&T in the United States.”
Additional commentary on the first quarter 2012 for Devices & Services and Nokia:
Nokia currently estimates that Devices & Services net sales in the first quarter 2012 were EUR 4.2 billion, comprised of Mobile Phones net sales of EUR 2.3 billion (71 million units), Smart Devices net sales of EUR 1.7 billion (12 million units), and Devices & Services Other net sales of EUR 0.2 billion. Based on the preliminary view, Nokia ended the first quarter 2012 around the high end of our normal 4 to 6 week channel inventory range, but on an absolute unit basis, channel inventories declined sequentially.
Nokia currently estimates that Devices & Services gross margin (including Devices & Services Other) for the first quarter 2012 was approximately 25%, with Mobile Phones gross margin of approximately 26% and Smart Devices gross margin of approximately 16%.
In the first quarter 2012, Nokia sold more than 2 million Lumia devices at an average selling price of approximately EUR 220 (reported within the Smart Devices business unit). Furthermore, Nokia has seen sequential growth in Lumia device activations every month since starting sales of Lumia devices in November 2011. Lumia has gained market share with both distribution partners and consumers. The Windows Phone ecosystem is also attracting developers and has expanded rapidly with more than 80,000 applications available.
Nokia currently estimates that at the end of the first quarter 2012, the company’s gross cash and other liquid assets were approximately EUR 9.8 billion, and Nokia’s net cash and other liquid assets were approximately EUR 4.9 billion. The sequential decline in net cash and other liquid assets was driven by Devices & Services, which experienced unfavorable and mostly non-recurring net working capital changes as well as operating losses. Nokia Siemens Networks contributed positively to Nokia’s cash flow in the first quarter 2012 due to net working capital improvements. This was despite Nokia Siemens Networks having a preliminarily estimated non-IFRS operating margin of approximately negative 5 percent in the first quarter 2012, in line with the previously provided outlook.
Actions to Address Competitive Industry Dynamics Affecting Devices & Services
Nokia is quickly taking action. Nokia will continue to increase its focus on accelerating Lumia sales, as well as on lowering the company’s cost structure, improving cash flow and maintaining a strong financial position.
– In the Smart Devices business unit, Nokia is increasing investments in Lumia to bring more products to more consumers in more markets.
– In the Mobile Phones business unit, Nokia is taking tactical pricing actions in the near term and plans to bring new products to market in the second quarter 2012.
– Nokia will accelerate planned cost reductions and will pursue additional significant structural actions if and when necessary.
“We are continuing to increase the clock speed of the company,” said Stephen Elop, President and CEO of Nokia. “The change is tangible, and we are proud of the way Nokia employees are quickly responding to the needs of consumers and partners.”
Nokia will provide full first quarter results and more details when it reports its first quarter 2012 results on April 19, 2012.

Apple has just posted their Q2 2012 financials, and revealed that over the last 14 weeks the company has pulled in $11.6 billion in profit on $39.2 billion in revenue, which breaks down to $12.30 per share. Analysts expected earnings of $10.02 per share on $36.81 billion in revenue.
Apple soundly exceeded the Q2 guidance they offered last quarter, as they forecasted earnings per share of $8.50 on $32.5 billion in revenues. For a bit of comparison, those figures are up substantially year over year — in Q2 2011, Apple pulled in $6 billion in profit on $24.7 billion in revenues.
The company also reports that they have sold 35.1 million iPhones this past quarter, up 88% year-over-year and beating most analysts expectations of devices sold. However, iPhone sales dipped 5.5% from last quarter. A total of 11.8 million iPads, 4 million Macs and 7.7 million iPods were also sold last quarter.
According to a poll of analysts conducted by CNNMoney, professional analysts expected the company to report just shy of 31 million iPhones sold, compared to the relatively high 37.25 million units sold as foretold by independent analysts.
There’s plenty more Apple coverage where this came from — for more, take a look at our liveblog of Apple’s earnings call.
The full release has been reproduced below:
CUPERTINO, Calif.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–
Apple® today announced financial results for its fiscal 2012 second quarter ended March 31, 2012. The Company posted quarterly revenue of $39.2 billion and quarterly net profit of $11.6 billion, or $12.30 per diluted share. These results compare to revenue of $24.7 billion and net profit of $6.0 billion, or $6.40 per diluted share, in the year-ago quarter. Gross margin was 47.4 percent compared to 41.4 percent in the year-ago quarter. International sales accounted for 64 percent of the quarter’s revenue.
The Company sold 35.1 million iPhones in the quarter, representing 88 percent unit growth over the year-ago quarter. Apple sold 11.8 million iPads during the quarter, a 151 percent unit increase over the year-ago quarter. The Company sold 4 million Macs during the quarter, a 7 percent unit increase over the year-ago quarter. Apple sold 7.7 million iPods, a 15 percent unit decline from the year-ago quarter.
“We’re thrilled with sales of over 35 million iPhones and almost 12 million iPads in the March quarter,” said Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO. “The new iPad is off to a great start, and across the year you’re going to see a lot more of the kind of innovation that only Apple can deliver.”
“Our record March quarter results drove $14 billion in cash flow from operations,” said Peter Oppenheimer, Apple’s CFO. “Looking ahead to the third fiscal quarter, we expect revenue of about $34 billion and diluted earnings per share of about $8.68.”
Apple will provide live streaming of its Q2 2012 financial results conference call beginning at 2:00 p.m. PDT on April 24, 2012 at http://www.apple.com/quicktime/qtv/earningsq212. This webcast will also be available for replay for approximately two weeks thereafter.

Oink, the first app from Kevin Rose’s new startup lab Milk, is shutting down. The announcement posted to the company’s homepage today claims the app was a “test” and the decision was made so that the company could focus on its next project, yet to be named.
For those unfamiliar, Oink is an app that lets you rate things at different places, similar to the ex-Googler founded startup Stamped (and parody app Jotly!). Instead of rating a restaurant or a bar, for example, you can rate a dish or a drink.
Likely due to brand name recognition (Rose, not Oink), the app initially saw a wave of downloads – 100,000 in the two and half weeks since its November 2011 launch. At the time, Rose said he was “pretty happy” abut the app’s growth, and detailed plans for future enhancements like curation and voting.
He also noted that he saw Oink’s monetization potential in being an interface for businesses that want to interact with and attract loyal customers. But he did say then that they were still in the “figuring out what sticks” mode. “First we have to prove that there’s value in seeing a bunch of people help curate what the best stuff is in a given place,” he explained.
By December, at Le Web, Rose revealed Oink had reached 150K users, seemingly signs of decent growth.
But perhaps Rose decided the margins on user reviews, even when successful, are generally poor. Case in point: Yelp’s gross margins in its S-1 filing. In February, for example, the third amendment to Yelp’s S-1 revealed its full-year financials showing that, while net revenues increased since 2009, operating losses increased right along with them. User reviews are often a tough business, and acquiring and keeping advertisers is difficult and expensive.
The full text posted to Oink’s website today reads:
Howdy,
We started Milk Inc. (the company behind Oink) to rapidly build and test out new ideas. Oink was our first test and, in preparing to move onto the next project, we’ve decided to shut it down to help focus our efforts.
Thank you so much to everyone who joined and contributed to Oink. You have been the heart of Oink. We are extremely grateful for all of your effort finding and rating the best things in the places around you. We’ve discovered thousands of awesome pizzas, pastas, coffees, teas… and roller coasters, zoo exhibits, paintings, sculptures, vistas… and sodas, salads, sliders, soups… and so much more.
So long and thanks for all the Oinks! More news from us soon,
The Milk Team

Apple’s iPad mini shipping times have slipped to a minimum of two weeks across the board, including for Wi-Fi only versions, which were the only ones initially set for an earlier, November 2 delivery. The white version actually sold out fastest, with pre-order ship times dropping to two weeks just 20 minutes or so after pre-orders began Friday morning at 12 AM PT/3 AM ET.
How does that compare with previous product launches? Well, the initial stock of iPhone 5s sold out in just about an hour, but pre-orders of the 3rd generation iPad with Retina Display released in March took a couple of days to sell out completely. Apple began taking pre-orders the day it unveiled the  “new iPad” on March 7, and they were out of initial stock by March 9. In other words, the iPad mini seems to be on pace with Apple’s tablet sales standards so far, though we won’t know about how much stock was available at launch for at least a little while yet.
On Thursday’s conference call discussing Apple’s quarterly earnings, CEO Tim Cook came back again and again to the challenges of iPad mini manufacturing, and how that affected gross margins. That might also indicate that we’ll see supply constraints early on, with demand outpacing supply (nothing new for an Apple product launch, of course). But regardless of initial shipping volumes, the iPad mini selling out initial supplies over a weekend provides some early evidence that some critics’ claims of Apple pricing itself out of market with the $329 iPad mini are likely unfounded.
As for why the white mini was so quick to sell out, judging by how long it took the black and slate version to get there, it looks like Apple could have a much more limited supply of the white version. It’ll be interesting to see in what ratios the different versions hit stores, and whether perhaps there are supply or manufacturing challenges around the white model.

The iPad mini seems downright hungry, and it has a taste not just for other small tablets on the market, but for its larger brethren, the iPad with Retina Display. Or at least, that’s what some analysts are saying, with expectations of the iPad mini’s cannibalization effect on existing iPad sales ranging from around 10 to 20 percent on average. But one suggests that it could be more like 50 percent, based on numbers Apple revealed at a recent court proceeding between itself and Samsung.
Tech-Thought’s Sameer Singh said that the 7.9-inch iPad mini will have a minimum of a 50 percent cannibalization rate of existing iPad sales, since the data from the trial showed that the iPad 2 was the most popular iPad sold over the course of the past summer, and ate into overall iPad sales about 58 to 61 percent. The reason and primary positive difference between the two? A $100 price drop compared to the 3rd generation iPad that went on sale the same time it got its retail value reduced.
Applying the logic that a $100 price cut caused that much cannibalization, it stands to reason that another $70 dip on top of that would have a compound effect and attract even more buyers away from Apple’s product, and that’s the linear thinking that Sing’s applying in this case. If he’s correct, Apple should still see increased sales overall, but a good chunk of those portions would be of lower value, owing to the smaller gross margins Apple has said itself it enjoys on iPad mini sales, and its lower overall cost.
Of course, not everyone is signing the same tune as Singh. In fact, Sterne Agee analyst Shaw Wu told me in an email conversation today that the firm is modelling 25 million iPad sales for Apple’s December quarter, which would be around 10 million more than it sold during the year ago period. And while Sterne Agee doesn’t break out iPad mini sales, since it believes Apple won’t either given previous reporting practices (the company doesn’t break out individual Mac or iPhone model sales, either), he says that will there “will be some degree of cannibalization,” he’s expecting iPad mini sales to be “mostly incremental,” meaning the mini will largely be adding to sales of other iPad models rather than replacing them.
To some extent, we may never know exactly how much the iPad mini is eating up overall iPad sales; Apple breaking out iPad 2 sales was an exception to its standard reporting practices brought on by court order. But there are a few reasons why it won’t matter even if it does provoke as extreme a shift in buying patterns as Singh predicts.
For one, Apple will see its tablet sales grow as a whole, and at a faster rate than it would’ve without the iPad. That’s better long-term for the ecosystem and for generating loyal, repeat customers. And while it might not make as much off of each individual iPad sale given a different product mix, manufacturing processes will improve, and I doubt very much that CEO Tim Cook’s definition of “significantly” lower margins is the same as yours or mine.
Apple also enjoys a demonstrated halo effect with its products, so if one line is selling well, the others tend to sell well also, with customers being introduced via one device and then branching out to others. More iPad minis likely lifts Apple’s Mac and iPhone boats, if not the regular iPad, too.
Finally, as Cook noted during his company’s conference call last week, Apple isn’t worried about product cannibalization, so long as that prevents other companies from coming in and eating its lunch. 50 percent or higher is almost certainly an unrealistically high rate of cannibalization, but even if it weren’t, those are all sales that Apple is getting instead of its competitors, and the company has never been shy about making sure it, and not anyone else, is putting out so-called iDevice “killers.”

The iPad mini’s gross margin is “significantly below” the rest of Apple’s product line at $329, Apple CFO Peter Oppenheimer said on the company’s conference call today. He said that’s driving lower guidance for the upcoming quarter despite a number of new products just-launched across its lineup of offerings.
“We’re unwilling to cut corners in delivering the best experiences in the world,” said Apple CEO Tim Cook. He stressed that the company is all about setting the bar high, perhaps implying that that’s what’s making gross margins slimmer on the iPad mini.
Oppenheimer added that the company hopes to improve margins with further supply chain and manufacturing process optimization as its production of the iPad mini continues to ramp up and become more efficient and cost-effective.
Launching the iPad mini required being “aggressive” on pricing according to Apple on the call, which is why the company chose to go below its ordinary margins. In past articles, I estimated that the bill-of-materials and construction costs might put the iPad mini within Apple’s existing range in terms of gross margins on hardware products, but it seems like the company’s unique design is keeping the iPad mini costs above the range I’d suggested.

Apple’s Q4 2012 results were mixed. As usual, reading Twitter, you’d think this was the end of the world. Nevermind that Amazon managed to post a loss on $13.8 billion in sales today — Apple only made $8.2 billion in profit. “Ahhhh!!!!! What is wrong with Apple?!!!” “This would have never have happened under Steve!”
That’s right, such a profit wouldn’t have happened under Steve. In fact, it never did. Jobs’ best quarter in terms of profit was just over $7 billion — and actually, that’s when Tim Cook was interim CEO last year.
But had you read TechCrunch in July, after Apple’s last “miss”, you would have been prepared. As we noted at the time:
Apple missed this past quarter, but the true shock could come if they miss next quarter as well. The guidance Apple gave indicates they’re thinking small (well, for them — it’s all relative, remember) as they prepare for a “fall transition”. Apple may well hit/beat their numbers next quarter, or they may not. Regardless, they’ll likely be fairly depressed again. But that’s only because everything is aligning for a mega Q1 holiday quarter. Again.
That’s exactly what we saw. Apple beat Wall Street revenue estimates, but missed in profit and earnings-per-share. Fairly depressed. Mixed. And yes, it’s largely because Apple has aligned their product might behind Q1. Think about this stat that Cook rattled off during the earnings call today: the products that Apple has released in the past six weeks are expected to make up 80 percent of sales in the coming quarter.
iPhone 5. 4th generation iPad. iPad mini. 13-inch retina MacBook Pro. New iMacs. New iPods. Etc.
The chamber will be out of bullets.
That’s why Apple is projecting revenue of $52 billion next quarter. It would be their biggest quarter ever — topping even last year’s monster Q1, which saw revenues hit $46 billion and blew Wall Street away. While Apple has missed Wall Street’s numbers here and there, they don’t miss their own. They’re clearly aiming for sales greater than $52 billion.
Still, some are disappointed that the next massive quarter will only be $6 billion higher than last year. And others can’t understand how Apple could miss on some of the numbers this past quarter. But it’s actually pretty easy to understand if you just stop. Think. And read between the lines.
The most important product in Apple’s arsenal is still by far the iPhone. Apple’s numbers basically live or die by these sales. Some people may have been disappointed that Apple’s numbers were up only slightly sequentially since the iPhone 5 came out last month, but it was actually only one sale for nine days in the quarter before it closed. Still, those nine days probably helped boost revenues just over last quarter. That in turn may have helped Apple get by revenue estimates. The iPhone 5 will fuel Apple’s next quarter past $50 billion.
The iPad situation was not nearly as good this past quarter. Apple actually sold fewer iPads sequentially. Cook noted that Apple expected this decline. But why? It is a pretty new product after all.
The first reason is K-12 sales. Those typically happen in the June quarter, not the September quarter. Clearly, they matter a lot to the iPad already. The second reason is that the June quarter was the first full quarter during with the new iPad (the third-generation) was on sale. That clearly boosted the numbers, and they fell back from there. And this may have also been related to the rumors of a new product — which of course ended up being the iPad mini.
Cook didn’t dwell on this factor nearly as much as his did last quarter for depressed iPhone sales (leading up to the iPhone 5), but he still mentioned that he believed it had an impact. Given that Apple just released not only the iPad mini, but the fourth-generation iPad as well, that will not be an issue next quarter, clearly.
Mac sales were good, but they simply don’t matter as much to Apple’s bottom line. It’s iPhone first, iPad second, Mac third.
Meanwhile, the iPod fell below a $1 billion business — both software and iTunes are now bigger when it comes to Apple’s revenues. In other words, Apple has lost one of the main “legs” of their table, as Jobs used to describe it.
So yes, Apple’s numbers were depressed this past quarter due to the biggest batch of product refreshes that Apple has ever done — the “fall transition, they’ve spoken about in the past — the seasonality of the iPad, and minimal impact of the iPhone 5.
More interesting is going forward. Again, people are upset about the $52 billion in revenue being put out there — which on one hand, is insane, but on the other, the EPS of $11.75 is far less than some were hoping for. Why is that?
Three things. Two major. One minor.
First, the minor. Last year, Apple’s Q1 was 14 weeks long. Usually, financial quarters are 13 weeks long, so this was an anomaly, which they noted at the time. This year, the same quarter will have the standard 13 weeks. Apple CFO Peter Oppenheimer made a point of saying this about a half dozen times on the call. Apple wants to make it clear that this extra week of sales do matter and analysts should set expectations (lower) accordingly.
One major reason for concern going forward is Apple’s margins. This past quarter, Apple was able to maintain a higher-than-expected 40 percent gross margin. Next quarter, they’re projecting 36 percent margins. That’s a significant decline.
So why will that drop take place? Two words.
iPad. Mini.
During the call, Oppenheimer noted that the iPad mini had a “gross margin is significantly below corporate average”. In other words, if the average is around 40 percent for Apple the past several quarters, iPad mini is in the 30s. (Or maybe lower though I’d guess not much lower.)
There has been a lot of questions the past few days as to why Apple would sell the iPad mini starting at $329 instead of say $299 or even $249, to get closer to the prices at which competitors are selling their smaller tablets. This is the reason. Apple is already dipping into uncomfortable margin territory for them.
And even at $329, Apple clearly expects to sell a lot of iPad minis this holiday season, thus lowering the overall margin.
The other major reason for Apple’s lower guidance is the iPhone 5 supply chain. Cook noted a few times that demand for the device remains huge and Apple cannot yet meet it. While he says conditions are improving, he would not commit to Apple being able to meet demand by the end of Q1. That means less iPhones sold than would otherwise be possible. That means less revenue.
The iPad mini will be the true wild card for Q1. If it does sell really well, Apple’s revenues could shoot through the roof again. But profit won’t raise as quickly due to the margin. This is important to remember.
It’s also interesting to note that the average selling price of the iPad fell significantly last quarter. Oppenheimer explained this is because the $399 iPad 2 continues to sell well. I’ve personally wondered why Apple is keeping the iPad 2 on the market with the fourth generation iPad and iPad mini now out there (and the third-generation iPad being removed). Apparently, this is why: it’s selling really well. That also suggests the $329 iPad mini is going to sell really well.
People want the iPad, but many seem to want it at the cheaper price points. It’s not like the iPhone which is subsidized down to $199 with the carriers paying Apple the full price directly.
Apple clearly also believes the iPad mini will cannibalize some of the larger iPad market. But Cook says they’re fine with that, as long as they’re the ones doing it. Still, the effect that will have on the margin is what will have Wall Street worried. The iPad is already a lower margin product than the iPhone. The iPad mini is lower still.
That’s why some people are disappointed with a $36 billion quarter that could lead to a $50 billion quarter next quarter. Apple has set a very high bar. And until they get a completely new product out there with a very high margin, they’ll continue to fly closer and closer to the sun. To a lesser extent, they will continue to reduce production costs, thus bolstering margins. But can they do it fast enough?
As for the just-unleashed Microsoft Surface tablet hurting iPad sales, Cook had this to say, “I suppose you could design a car that flies and floats. But I don’t think it would do all of those things very well.”

Apple’s iPad mini announcement is set for early next week, and the big variable still remains price. Now, a couple of new reports that surfaced this weekend shed a little more light on what we might expect with pricing. KGI Securities analysts Ming-Chi Kuo has an early look at the likely bill-of-materials (BOM) for the iPad mini, and 9t05Mac reports on likely U.S. retail pricing, meaning we can take a closer look at how the iPad mini might figure into Apple’s existing lineup when it comes to comparing gross margins.
Kuo’s estimate of the BOM and manufacturing costs of an iPad mini will start at $195 for a 16GB Wi-Fi only version, and range up to $254.50 for the 64GB, LTE + Wi-Fi edition. His estimates are based on educated guesses, existing price and component lists from other Apple devices, and reported suppliers of parts for this new tablet. Separately, 9t05Mac has information indicating price points of $329, $429 and $529 for 16, 32  and 64GB Wi-Fi only models of iPad mini, and $459, $559 and $659 for Wi-Fi + LTE versions in corresponding capacities. That works out to a gross margin of 40.73 percent at the low end, and 61.38 percent for the fully loaded iPad mini.
Margins are Apple’s bread and butter, as I explained in a previous post, and the reason it manages to stay ahead of its gadget-making competition in terms of market cap, profits and cash on hand. The iPhone 5, for instance, carries a gross margin of 68 percent for entry-level devices, and  72 percent for its most expensive model, thanks to a markup of 256.72 percent. But taking these two reports together puts an iPad well within acceptable limits for Apple – the newest iPad has a 36.66 percent gross margin for the 16GB Wi-Fi model, and a 50.70 percent margin for top-end devices.
Unlike Amazon, Apple just wouldn’t market a device on which it was merely breaking even or losing money, since it isn’t driving the bulk of its revenue from its digital content ecosystem (though it does take in a fair amount that way, too). But taking these two new pieces of information together, you can see how Apple would be able to market a new device at a price point considerably under its existing iPad offerings and still enjoy margins well within its existing acceptable range.
Of course, if 9t05Mac’s information is accurate, that would also mean that the iPad mini would be priced well over the cost of entry of competing devices like the Nexus 7 and Amazon Kindle Fire. But as mentioned, shipping hardware as a loss leader just isn’t an arrow in Apple’s quiver, and besides, Apple won’t be framing the discussion around place, but instead will emphasize quality and the reputation of the original iPad line, and I have a feeling those are arguments that a lot of consumers will find convincing.

HTC today officially released its financials for Q3, and the news continues to be bad for the Taiwanese smartphone maker: the company reported revenues of 70.2 billion Taiwan dollars ($2.4 billion), down 23% from last quarter’s $3 billion and 48% compared to the same quarter last year. The company also provided a trading update for the all-important holiday period encompassed by Q4 and the numbers are not pretty: it anticipates revenues of NT$60 billion, or $2 billion. Earnings per share are down by nearly 80% to NT$4.70 ($0.16).
The company does not report how many handsets it has sold, but figures out today from IDC put the number at 7.3 million for the quarter, a decline of 42.5% on last year. It still manages to get into the top-five handset makers with a 4% share. Still, it is proving no match for rival Android maker Samsung, which has over a 30% share of the world’s smartphone market with estimated shipments of 56.3 million handsets for the quarter.
These numbers put HTC’s strategy to launch daily deals in Europe, announced today, into perspective: the company is trying to focus on services not only as an alternative revenue stream, but as a way of driving users to its devices.
In its overview, HTC noted, as it did last quarter, that China continues to be a major driver of business for the company. That will point to HTC looking at selling lower and lower-cost handsets, I suspect, since these are the primary driver of sales in that market, especially in the uber-competitive area of Android-based handsets. (iPhone is another story, catering as it does to the premium market.) In any case, offering lower-cost handsets will also hit right at HTC’s margin.
And that margin is looking pretty bad: it says the gross margin for Q3 was 25%, down 3% since last year. HTC expects gross margin for Q4 to be 23%. Operating margin for Q3 was 7%, down from 9% in the last quarter and less than half of what it was a year ago (14.9%). Next quarter will be much worse: that operating margin will be only 1% next quarter.
Meanwhile, in other markets, HTC says that the U.S. is “in line with expectations”: Europe is “focused on enhancing brand consideration” (? developing brand profile, I suppose); and the company continues to invest in South Asia. But it does not break out the performance in those individual regions.
Operating profit is at its lowest point in five quarters, currently standing at NT$4.9 billion, versus NT$20.2 billion a year ago, a drop of 54%.
HTC has continued to push ahead with investments and launches to turn things around. They include two new Windows Phone 8 handsets that will be coming to market in November as well as a $35 million strategic investment for 17% of enterprise platform maker Magnet Systems. But it also took a charge of $40 million in its OnLive cloud-based gaming investment when that company hit bankruptcy and needed to restructure (as a new OnLive).
Unsurprisingly, all has had a big impact on its cash position, which is now at NT$202 million, down 23% on a year ago.

A raft of smartphone market analyst numbers are out and they all continue to make very pleasant reading for Samsung — the maker of the Galaxy range of smartphones — underlining the success of the Korean company’s strategy of steamrollering the competition by offering an extensive portfolio of mobile devices at a variety of screen sizes and price points vs. the handful of iPhones Apple offers.
Android OEM Samsung retained its number one smartphone maker position in the quarter and shipped more than double the smartphones of second-placed Apple, according to the analyst figures. ABI Research has Samsung shipping 55.5 million smartphones in Q3 2012 to grab a record 35 percent marketshare, versus Apple’s 26.9 million smartphones (and 17 percent marketshare).
ABI said Samsung posted almost double the year-on-year growth rate of Apple, enjoying a 109.2 percent YoY smartphone shipment bump, compared to Apple’s growth of 57.6 percent YoY.  The next four largest smartphone makers in the quarter — Nokia, HTC and RIM — all posted large YoY shipment declines. Nokia was pushed out of the top three global smartphone vendors for the first time, while rising star — Chinese mobile maker ZTE — posted the most impressive growth of all the smartphone makers tracked: shipping 8.3 million smartphones in Q3, up from 3.1 million in the year-ago quarter, to achieve YoY growth of 168.4 percent.

Commenting on the numbers in a statement, ABI senior analyst Michael Morgan, noted: “Samsung looks to be running away from the pack while Apple’s new product portfolio continues to eat into its decreasing gross margins. Apple will need to ship over 94 million smartphones in Q4 if it wants to match its 2011 shipment growth of 96 percent.”
Also posting smartphone stats, Strategy Analytics had Samsung holding 35.2 percent of the market in Q3 vs Apple’s 16.6 percent — with 56.9 million and 26.9 million shipments respectively. Neil Shah, Senior Analyst at Strategy Analytics, noted in a statement: “Samsung and Apple combined now account for over half of all smartphones shipped worldwide, up from around one-third a year ago. Volumes have polarized around those two brands.”
Samsung’s worldwide shipment volumes for the quarter are the largest number of units ever shipped by a smartphone vendor in a single quarter, Strategy Analytics added.
Analyst, IDC, pegged Samsung’s Q3 smartphone shipments at 56.3 million versus Apple’s 26.9 million — giving Samsung marketshare of 31.3 percent, just over double Apple’s 15 percent.
IDC said: “Samsung’s growth was fueled in large part by its broad, deep, and refreshed Android portfolio, highlighted by the full quarter availability of its flagship model Galaxy S III. In addition, the company announced multiple mid-range and mass-market models, including a new Windows Phone, the ATIV S.”
Analyst Juniper also reported 56.3 million smartphone shipments in Q3 for Samsung vs 26.9 million for Apple. Juniper said Samsung’s flagship Galaxy SIII device played “a key role” in Samsung’s record quarter — with estimated sales of 18 million for the device in Q3.
“The Galaxy SIII has been a phenomenal success for Samsung this year, bettering its sales over the previous quarter. Samsung has been highly effective in leveraging its global brand strength and the popularity of the Android OS to drive sales of smartphones in all price tiers,” the analyst noted.
Nokia remains in the doldrums thanks to the Finnish mobile maker’s Windows Phone-based devices not making a significant impact, it said — noting Nokia shipped just 6.3 million in Q3 — a 63 percent fall compared to Q3 2011.

In a separate report on iPhone owner brand loyalty, Strategy Analytics also noted that the number of iPhone owners who say they definitely will or probably will purchase their next phone from the same brand has declined in both the U.S. and Western Europe for the first time — dropping from 88 percent in 2011 to 75 percent in 2012. The analyst says a key factor in this decline is rival smartphone makers offering devices with larger screens than the iPhone.

Strategy Analytics research last year showed 4.3 inches as the most preferred size, while “early provisional” results from an update to this research suggest 4.5 inches may be the most preferred size for respondents surveyed from June-December 2012.
Despite this drop in brand loyalty, the analyst notes that Apple retains a higher repeat purchase intention level than any other major phone manufacturer it surveyed. Respondents who say they probably or definitely will not buy their next phone from Apple is “low”, it adds.

Price was perhaps always the most anticipated feature of the iPad mini, and now it’s proving the most controversial. My Twitter stream has been filled with arguments back and forth on the iPad mini’s $329 price tag, with many weighing in saying it’s too expensive and that Apple missed the mark.
It’s a funny discussion in a lot of ways, because it’s one that people often have around Apple products, especially at the introduction of a brand new line or device. Don’t believe me? Take a look at the following headlines from 2010, shortly following the original iPad’s introduction.
And, maybe my favorite given all that’s happened since:
So while a lot of similar headlines are popping up this time around, we now have the benefit of hindsight to add some clarity to the discussion. There’s also a fair number of logical reasons Apple has priced this tablet correctly, history lessons notwithstanding.
Apple operates as, and is perceived as a premium brand. With some of their recent pricing accomplishments, including the MacBook Air starting at $999 and the iMac now beginning at $1299, it’s easy to see why people might think Apple is playing along with the rest of the market’s race to lower prices. But that’s not how Apple competes, and that’s not how it ships product.
Much of the value in Apple lies in its brand cachet, something which is especially powerful in emerging Asian markets, but also still very effective in established regions like North America. Apple is seen as a maker of premium goods, and they emphasized that amply with this iPad, bringing back a lot of the same rhetoric they used to portray the iPhone 5 as a precision instrument, on par with the finest mechanical watches.
Apple’s identity as a luxury brand clearly has a strong marketing component, but it also arises naturally from making great products. The iPad mini is meant to compete on quality with others out there in the smaller tablet space, not price, just like the Mac does in the notebook and desktop market (where its growth outpaces the rest of the industry, by the way).
Almost all of Apple’s marketing around this device focuses on its ability to exceed the competition in terms of usability, design and quality of experience. That’s also how it has traditionally marketed the Mac. With the original iPad, it had a leg up in that it was forging a new market, but it’s coming late to the small tablet space. Still, by competing on its own terms, and delivering a product that definitely does feel more polished than other options out there, it’s saying the extra $129 you’ll pay versus others is money well spent.
And Apple’s right on that score. As I mentioned in a Branch discussion on the subject, the iPad displays approximately 49 percent more content when viewing web pages horizontally than the Nexus 7, according to Apple SVP Phil Schiller, and at $329 it’s around 49 percent more expensive than the Nexus 7
Apple sells hardware, and that’s its main concern. Amazon and Google are not hardware companies, and don’t pretend to be. They sell devices because it furthers their own primary agendas (e-commerce for Amazon, search and ad revenue for Google) and can accordingly do so at a loss.
For Apple to market a device it must be profitable. And not just profitable, but within their acceptable range of what defines profitability, which means significant gross margins made on every device. Otherwise, it’s not worth Apple’s time to make that product, and it won’t be made.
The iPad mini is priced where Apple can price it while still creating a quality product that doesn’t feel like a crippled device, while still satisfying their profitability requirements. If it was a 7-inch tablet with a single camera and a much thicker design, I’d say it was overpriced, but as it is, if you look at what it can do, it’s more than competitive and meets Apple’s business requirements for bringing a new product to market.
Those claiming this iPad is too expensive are either forgetting the past or forgetting what kind of company Apple is, but I don’t think consumers will be among that crowd. But you don’t have to take my word for it: pre-orders start Friday, and we’ll probably learn soon after just how much appetite there is out there for Apple’s latest innovation.

$46.33 billion in revenue. It’s a number the biggest and best tech companies in the world can only dream to hit in a year. Apple hit it in one quarter. $13.06 billion in profit. It’s a number no tech company would ever aspire to in one quarter because it’s ridiculous. The only companies that have ever thought about such numbers are oil companies. And even then, only 3 of them have actually hit it. Ever.
Until yesterday.
I’ve already tried to give some context to the stunning Q1 2012 results that Apple posted. But the truth is that they’re still unbelievable. Perhaps the next step should be to figure out how they could post such numbers.
The simple answer is that Apple’s iPhone sales were off the charts. 37 million units sold is mind-boggling when the previous record was 20 million, set in Q3 2011. A year ago, in the same holiday quarter, Apple sold “just” 16 million iPhones. That was also a record at the time and lead to record revenue and profit at the time. This year, Apple quite simply took things to the next level — and then went a level beyond that.
Because the iPhone is over 50 percent of Apple’s revenues, amazing iPhone sales equates to amazing revenues. Again, the simple answer. But to figure out why this quarter was so far ahead of any other quarter, you have to go deeper. It was really a confluence of events.
First of all, this past quarter was set up by the preceding quarter, which saw Apple fall short of Wall Street expectations for the first time in years. But as we noted at the time, this was misleading. Apple surpassed their own expectations (which isn’t surprising given that they’re always low), but failed to meet Wall Street’s simply because Wall Street’s numbers were lazy. Analysts didn’t take into account the fact that the new version of the iPhone did not launch in the summertime, as it had in years past. Because it did not — and again, the iPhone is about half of Apple’s revenue — there was no burst in iPhone sales that Apple usually sees in Q4.
Instead, that burst came in Q1 — last quarter. And unlike previous years, this burst was compounded because Q1 is also Apple’s holiday quarter. A new iPhone plus holiday shopping season is apparently like gasoline on a fire. Now we know.
But it would be foolish to think that Apple’s big numbers were only about the iPhone. Remember, Apple set new records in Mac and iPad sales as well. The iPad in particular is interesting because while it’s Apple’s newest business, it’s already the second-largest in terms of revenue. This past quarter, 20 percent of revenue came from iPad sales.
The third-biggest source of revenue is Mac sales — they accounted for 14 percent of Apple’s revenue last quarter. In other words, 87 percent of Apple’s revenue last quarter was from products that all saw record sales.
The lone dim spot in Apple’s numbers were iPod sales, which continue to decline year-over-year. But because the other businesses have grown so massive, so quickly, the iPod only accounts for 5 percent of Apple’s revenues now. Pretty soon — maybe even next quarter — the iTunes Store itself will be a bigger money-maker for the company. When you consider that iTunes (including the App Store) was initially set up to be run as a break-even business, this is impressive.
Something else to consider: the iPhone, iPad, and Mac have the highest margins amongst Apple major products. The iPhone 4S, because it is largely based off of the design of the iPhone 4, probably has one of the best margins that Apple has ever seen. That rings especially true when you hear that Apple’s overall gross margin for the quarter was 44.7 percent. It’s a number so big that Apple CFO Peter Oppenheimer said he couldn’t recall ever seeing a number so high in his 15 years of service. And he was skeptical that Apple would ever hit it again.
That huge margin meant huge profit. In fact, it meant profit the likes of which had never been seen before by a technology company.
Something else: Q1 2012 for Apple happened to span 14 weeks. This was unusual, and Apple was quick to note as much in both their press release and on the earnings call. Normally, quarters span 13 weeks (do the math: 13 x 4 = 52). You simply cannot discount an extra week of sales. And you especially cannot discount it during the holiday quarter.
And one more thing: the passing of Apple co-founder Steve Jobs in October drove people all around the world to Apple Stores to pay their respects. When people visit Apple Stores, they don’t often walk away empty handed. And what better way to pay respect to Jobs than to buy a product from the company he cared so much about? It’s a delicate subject, but worth mentioning.
Again, this monster quarter was all about a confluence of events. It was about a new iPhone launch during Apple’s typically busiest quarter merged with a newer product, iPad, coming into its own, and the Mac continuing its methodical growth. Add to that amazing margins plus one more week of sales — and the fact that Apple as a whole has been killing it for several years now across the board — and you get a jaw-dropping quarter. It all came together.
Next question: will Apple be able to replicate the magic next quarter? Well, no. The quarter after the holiday one is typically weaker as consumer spending cools. And when you consider that it will span the regular 13 weeks instead of 14, you have two things working against it. Add to that the fact that the iPhone 4S will no longer be a new product, and you have another dip. There could be a new iPad in the quarter — but it may only go on sale at the tail-end. Or it may not be on sale until the following quarter — we’ll see. Either way, that probably dings iPad sales a bit next quarter too.
But even with all those things working “against” Apple next quarter, Oppenheimer still gave guidance of $32.5 billion in revenue. That would be Apple’s second-best quarter ever. And again, Apple always low-balls such numbers, so perhaps $35 billion in a more reasonable guess.
In other words, Apple may only have the second-best quarter of any tech company ever in terms of revenue next quarter. And profits may only be near the bottom of the all-time top 20 amidst the oil empires. Boo hoo.

Smartphone maker Sony Ericsson this morning posted a pre-tax loss of 247 million euros ($318 million) in the fourth quarter of 2011, after reporting a profit of 31 million euros in Q3 2011. The company, a 50:50 joint-venture between Sony and Ericsson, blames “intense competition”, “price erosion” and effects from the flooding in Thailand as some of the main drivers for the drop.
Sales for the quarter were approximately 1.3 billion euros, down 16 percent year-on-year. 
The fourth quarter of last year ended in a net loss of 207 million euros ($266.5 million), compared to a net income of 8 million euros ($10.3 million) in the same quarter of the previous year.
Analysts were actually expecting a modest profit from the company, so this is quite a shock.
Sony will soon acquire Ericsson’s 50 percent share of Sony Ericsson in a deal valued at 1.05 billion euros – the transaction is expected to take place “late January to February 2012”. 
Sony Ericsson’s huge loss in Q4 2011 will impact Ericsson’s operating income with SEK -1.1 b. (125 million euros) in the quarter, the latter company said this morning.
Update with more information from Sony Ericsson’s earnings report:
Its gross margin for the quarter was 24 percent, a decrease of 6 points year-on-year and 3 percentage points from the previous quarter.
The company shipped 9 million units during Q4 2011, a 20 percent decrease year-on-year and a 5 percent decrease compared to Q3. Sony Ericsson has shipped 28 million Xperia (Android) smartphones to date.
Even though Sony Ericsson intends to go all-smartphone during 2012, feature phones still make up some 20 percent of its sales volumes.

To paraphrase Otto von Bismarck, “iPads are like sausages, it is better not to see them being made.” It’s an ugly story. Over a hundred employees “injured by n-hexane, a toxic chemical that can cause nerve damage and paralysis” because its use “meant workers could clean more screens each minute.” Other workers killed or injured by explosions. All so that iPads can be built as cheaply as possible, so that Apple can maintain its 44.7% gross margins. Isn’t that awful?
Yes, of course — but let’s try to maintain a nuanced perspective here. This is hardly a new story, and it’s hardly unique to the tech industry. Think of the exploitation of child labor to harvest Egyptian cotton and Cote d’Ivoire cocoa. Plus ça change; a decade ago it was Indonesian sweatshops and Indian fireworks exciting outrage. Think of the exploitation of Congolese workers to mine coltan, used in electronics everywhere. Show me a country with a large population of desperately poor people, and I’ll show you horrific exploitation of impoverished workers.
Please note, though, that the latter is an inevitable symptom of the former; and again, let’s please try to maintain a sense of perspective. It’s awful that a dozen Chinese workers were killed and hundreds injured building iPads–but at the same time, coal mining kills more than two thousand Chinese workers a year (down from almost 7000 ten years ago) and nobody’s suddenly outraged about them. We in the West don’t really seem to care that Chinese employees work under awful conditions and die in appalling numbers — unless they make shiny things that we use. We claim we don’t want people to suffer, but in fact we just don’t want our iProducts tainted by that suffering. Isn’t that more than a little hypocritical?
So what? you might say. It’s all horrible! Stop them all, or any of it that we can stop, right now! Right?
No. Not necessarily. This is a really complex and difficult issue, and there’s no obvious right answer. Over the last thirty years, trade and export-driven growth have been insanely great for China, and made life enormously better for the overwhelming majority of its billion-plus people. (My personal experience bears out all the data, for what it’s worth: in 1997 I spent a month roaming solo through central China, then came back nine years later. China 1997 and China 2006 were like two entirely different nations, and the latter was vastly better off.)
If Apple and other Western manufacturers were to pull production from China to other, better-paid, union-friendlier jurisdictions with stronger protections for worker rights, that would be disastrous for Apple’s profit margins and innovation speed — but it would also be disastrous for China’s people. On the whole, overall, despite the gruesome and heartrending disasters in the spotlight right now, both sides benefit greatly. That’s how and why free trade works.
At the same time, we can all agree that no businesses anywhere should be poisoning their workers and/or generally treating human lives like disposable Kleenex. This is especially true in a nation whose government only accepts trade unions which are powerless government puppets. But I would argue that it’s China’s steadily growing wealth — which comes from trade, and especially, manufacturing — that will ultimately transform it into a nation where real unions and real worker rights can and do exist.
It’s worth noting that Foxconn’s problems are China’s national problems writ small. Hexane pollution and aluminum dust are scale-model versions of the nationwide poisoned milk scandal, or the ongoing catastrophe of Beijing’s hyper-polluted air, or the major lakes entirely conquered by toxic cyanobacteria. Again, employee exploitation is a symptom, not a problem. The problem is ubiquitous grinding poverty – something that trade, investment, and economic growth slowly, over decades, alleviates, albeit at a terrifying cost to the environment.
Think of the West’s Industrial Revolution. That’s more or less the same revolution transforming China right now. Is it possible to have such a revolution without some concomitant Dickensian horrors? The available evidence sadly indicates “probably not.”
In the interim, what Apple (and the countless less-sexy enterprises whose products are manufactured in China under similar conditions) can do to improve the lot of those who craft its wares is this: increase their leverage over their suppliers, by making the threat of moving production elsewhere credible. Foxconn wants to keep Apple happy, obviously – but they’d be a lot more proactive about doing so if they genuinely thought they might lose massive amounts of Apple’s business to someone else.
A concrete example: Apple shouldn’t get Foxconn to manufacture iPads in Brazil: they should have another company entirely build iPads in Brazil. Right now Apple needs Foxconn almost as much as Foxconn needs Apple. Real competition among suppliers would mean that each of them will jump a lot higher and faster when Apple says “worker rights.”
But let’s not get myopic about Apple and iPads, when the landscape of globalization and its excesses is so much vaster and more diverse. Let’s not pretend that the dynamic is purely “rich Western tech companies exploiting poor nations.” And let’s remember that technology, and China’s growing wealth, will probably ultimately solve this problem. Remember that decade-old outrage about child labor in India’s fireworks industry? Well, it’s much diminished these days, thanks to automation and India’s much wealthier society. Similarly, China’s burgeoning online population has pressured its government to pay attention to air pollution… and Foxconn is already roboticizing its assembly lines.
Most of all, let’s not lose sight of the fact that the technology pioneered in large part by the very same cohort of Western companies who outsource production to China is, slowly but steadily, lifting China, India and sub-Saharan Africa out of poverty. That, not where your iPad came from, is the most important story in the world today.

Simply looking over the numbers, it might be hard to wrap your head around what Apple just announced for their Q1 2012 results. A company this big is not supposed to be able to nearly double revenue year-to-year. Nor are they supposed to more than double profit. But Apple did both. The numbers are so big that they almost seem like they should be typos — especially coming after a quarter that was a “miss” (though we can now clearly see what a joke that “miss” was). So perhaps it’s best to point out some bigger numbers and to frame some of them in ways to make them easier to understand. That’s what all of Twitter seemed to be doing anyway during the earnings call this afternoon.
Apple’s profit of $13.1 billion was equal to their revenue in Q4 2010, as Jordan Golson notes. To be clear, that was just a year and a quarter ago. That’s how quickly Apple is growing.
Apple added $38 billion in cash to its reserves just in the past year alone, as Horace Dediu points out. They now have $97.6 billion in cash and equivalents. $64 billion of that is offshore, Apple CFO Peter Oppenheimer stated during the call — meaning, it would cost money (taxes) to bring it back into the U.S.
Apple’s cash hoard alone is worth more than all but 52 companies on Earth, as Dennis Berman notes.
Apple earned more money last quarter than the entire company was worth (in terms of market cap) just eight years ago, as Mathew Ingram relays from Eddy Elfenbein.
Apple likely sold three times as many iPads as Amazon sold Kindle Fires. At twice the price. And at a profit, as Jon Fortt notes. When asked about the impact of the lower-cost tablets, Apple CEO Tim Cook specifically mentioned the Kindle Fire and noted that when looking over Apple’s numbers, they didn’t seem to see any impact (positive or negative) from the Kindle Fire being on the market.
Apple’s revenues, while massive, are nothing compared to a company like Walmart, which reported $109.5 billion in revenue last quarter. BUT that $109.5 billion only turned into $3.3 billion of actual income for the quarter. In other words, Walmart has more than double the revenues of Apple, but Apple has more than four times the profits of Walmart. That’s remarkable.
Apple’s profits place them on this exclusive list of the most profitable quarters among corporations. You’ll note that Apple is the only company on the list that’s not an oil and gas company. And they’re a “mere” $3.2 billion from the top spot.
Back in July, we noted that while Apple was destroying their tech peers in profits, HP still held the revenue crown. Not anymore. HP’s last reported quarter (in November) saw the company announce $32.1 billion in revenue. They’ll report Q1 2012 earnings in about a month, but if history is any guide, Apple will be far, far ahead of both numbers. Likely well over $10 billion ahead.
It was only October of 2010 when Apple passed Microsoft in terms of revenue. At the time, Apple posted $20.34 billion — they’re well beyond double that now. Microsoft’s most recent quarter saw record revenue of $20.9 billion. Again, Apple came in at $46.33 billion.
Meanwhile, it was only April of last year that Apple surpassed Microsoft’s in profit. This past quarter, Microsoft’s net income was $6.62 billion. Apple’s was $13.06 billion.
The iTunes Store alone generated 50 percent more revenue than all of Yahoo did last quarter, as Jordan Golson notes.
Likewise, the amount Apple paid to third-party developers via the App Store last quarter ($700 million) is more than double Yahoo’s overall profits. (Overall, Apple has paid over $4 billion to third-party developers now via the App Store.)
It would take TechCrunch parent AOL cloning itself 124 times to be as big as Apple, notes Mike Brown Jr. No idea what the metric is there, but sounds about right. (See: update at bottom)
Apple’s profits for the last quarter exceed Google’s entire revenue for the last quarter, as Farhad Manjoo points out. And it’s not even close ($13 billion to $10.6 billion). Think about that for a second.
And actually, Apple’s profit for the entire year now beats Google’s revenue for the entire year, as Marcel Molina points out. That gap is likely to get bigger given the most recent quarter.
After a short halt in after-hours trading following the earnings release, Apple’s stock popped nearly 10 percent from where it closed at the end of the day. Since then, it has settled back into the $450-a-share range which would be far and away a new record high for the stock if and when it opens around there tomorrow. That surge also pushes Apple well beyond the $400 billion market cap — and once again past Exxon as the most valuable public company in the world.
At over $400 billion, Apple is now worth more than Greece, CNN Tech says.
Towards the end of the earnings call, Tim Cook dropped a huge nugget of information: led by 15 million iPads sold last quarter, the tablet market is now larger than the entire desktop PC market. Someday in the not-too-distant future, the tablet market will be bigger than all of the PC market, he predicts. (Apple has sold 55 million iPads since the original launch in April 2010, Cook revealed.)
Apple’s gross margin for the quarter was 44.7 percent — a number which Oppenheimer stated he’s never seen in his 15 years at Apple. Of note, he also doesn’t expect Apple to ever post a margin that high again.
Apple sold half as many Apple TVs last quarter (1.4 million) as they did for the entire previous fiscal year. But Cook still considers the product a “hobby” — though it’s one he “couldn’t live without”.
Apple’s profit last quarter was $3 billion more than all of Hollywood’s gross box office receipts for all of last year, notes Eric Spiegelman via Anthony De Rosa.
With 37 million iPhones sold last quarter, Apple is now the largest smartphone marker, besting Samsung’s (guesstimated) 35 million, as The Next Web remembers.
Apple is now selling twice as many iPads to K-12 schools as Macs. Perhaps that will help with this issue.
But perhaps all you really need is a picture. Just look at the chart Macworld made below. It’s absolutely staggering.

Update: Mike Brown Jr. messaged me with the following:
I’m actually dead wrong on AOL size – Aol would need to clone itself 260 times on market cap vs market cap basis.  And here I was thinking AOL was around a 3b market cap.  Crazy numbers…

HTC has posted its Q2 numbers and they’re not pretty. While numbers were up on Q1, the Taiwanese Android/Windows Phone smartphone maker saw declines in nearly every line of earnings compared to the same quarter a year ago. Revenues were 91.04 billion Taiwan dollars ($3 billion), down nearly 27% on Q2 2011 (and missing consensus analyst expectations); gross profit was down by more than 30% to NT24.59 billion ($819 million); operating profit down by over 57% to NT8.2 billion ($273 million). Earnings per share were also down by nearly 57% to NT8.9 ($0.30) per share.
HTC also provided a sober look at the quarter ahead. It expects that in Q3 revenues will drop even further to NT$70-80 billion ($2.3-2.7 billion), with the gross margin also dropping down to 25%, and the operating margin also coming down to 7%.
The results show that despite gains in some key markets like China (and a slight one in the U.S.), HTC continues to see huge competitive pressure in the smartphone segment in which it competes. This year, in an effort to better focus the company, HTC launched a line of handsets under the brand “HTC One”, which followed a similar convention to Apple with its streamlined iPhone line-up.
In its short earnings statement (which will likely see more elaboration during the conference call later today at 8AM Eastern time) HTC also emphasized its success in China, noting it was “well positioned to become a key growth driver.” Just as Canalys noted yesterday, the company highlighted operator partnerships as a key part of the equation, along with brand awareness and increasing retail presence.
Overall HTC said Asia was meeting expectations for the launch of the One line. But noticeably the key North American and European markets did not get mentioned in that context. Instead, these have been seeing “increasing marketing and sales efforts in North America & EMEA.”
Based on comments from April (via Slashgear), when HTC’s CEO Peter Chou was frank about how hard it would be for the company to claw back lost market share in the U.S. (where it currently accounts for only 6.4% of all smartphone users, says comScore), HTC may have already given up the ghost on this one.
But if it is still holding out for a recovery, HTC will have to spend even more (read: more margin/profit pressures) to try to make better headway in these two markets, where it once commanded a respectable presence but has more recently been hit hard by competition, partly from Apple, but also from other Android players, primarily from Samsung.
HTC, like Samsung, makes smartphones based mainly on Google’s Android operating system, with a secondary line based on Microsoft’s Windows Phone OS. But despite being a very early mover in smartphones — it was Microsoft’s first handset partner for its smartphone forays, and Google’s first Android handset maker — HTC has not managed to hold on to its lead.
Unlike Samsung, HTC focuses only on smartphones (and, increasingly, a streamlined lineup of models). That means that HTC offers a less diversified range to the market, and that makes it more susceptible to feeling a pinch when its main/only line of business is not performing that well. While feature phones are getting gradually replaced by smartphones in the overall market, there is still a strong business to be had in the lower end models, as both Samsung and Nokia have shown. And it also provides a customer base loyal to a brand that can be tapped for upgrades. (Apple has been the one standout in the market that seems to have bucked this trend.)

In mobile world, bigger is not always better. That can be the case for specs, and it can also be the case for market share: and a report out today from Juniper Research highlights a case in point for the latter: Samsung was the biggest smartphone maker in terms of global shipments in Q1 2012, but when it came to making money, Apple was still on top.
In Q1, Samsung is estimated to have shipped 46.9 million smartphones, compared to Apple’s 35.1 million iPhone devices. When considering revenues, however, the tables turn: Apple’s mobile revenues (which include the iPad) were $29.3 billion, while Samsung’s (which include all its mobile products, including feature phones) were just over half of that amount: $17 billion.
And while Apple is beating Samsung in terms of pure revenue, it’s likely also to be beating Samsung in terms of profitability of those devices. When Apple reported another blockbuster quarter when it released its earnings last week, it noted that its gross margin had reached 47.4 percent. Samsung’s margin, on the other hand, was at 12.9 percent.
Juniper, a UK-based research group, notes that although Apple and Samsung have “taken it in turns” to lead the market, it appears that Samsung has now established itself as the bigger player in volumes.
The back-and-forth between the two also is a sign of their collective power at the moment: together, the pair snapped up nearly 60 percent of the whole smartphone market, which totaled 139 million units for the quarter. In Q4, the market share of Apple+Samsung was only 46 percent — which is a measure also of how rapidly others (most notably RIM and Nokia) have declined over that time.
Unless Apple throws us a curve ball and launches another new device before the WWDC in June, it looks like Samsung will continue to remain in the lead for shipments in this quarter. That will be on the strength of its wide portfolio, covering a range of price points, as well as new launches. Case in point: it’s gearing up for the official launch of its newest Android powerhouse, the Galaxy SIII, later this week.

The graphic above, depicting market shares for different mobile brands, tells a pretty stark story about what has happened to competitors as Apple and Samsung have gone up, but the game is far from over for the other players, notes Juniper analyst Daniel Ashdown.
Yes, Nokia only shipped 11.9 million smartphones in the quarter — less than one-third of Apple’s number; the numbers for RIM, which reports on a different schedule, are not likely to be encouraging, either; and HTC has stopped giving out sales volumes altogether. But since Juniper believes the smartphone market will account for 1.1 billion devices shipped by 2017 — up from 600 million in 2012 — these players still have a shot to turn things around.

Early-stage venture firm Y Combinator‘s 15th Demo Day is underway with 75 startup presentations throughout the day. It’s the firm’s biggest and most selective class to date, and Mountain View’s Computer Science Museum is packed with roughly 400 or so investors and observers.
You can meet the startups from batches one, three, and four, plus read our coverage of how Y Combinator pitches are changing, but now let’s look at the second set of companies that demo-ed their work to VC firms, angels, and the press:

Flightfox says its search engine can be more efficient and and cost-effective than competitors like Expedia. It’s a marketplace of real people (like travel agents) who work competitively against each other to find you the very best flight. Basically the way it works is this: you put in your travel dates and places, choose an amount to award the finder of the best fare, and sit back and let the contest take place. The company says it has already made $120,000 in finder’s fees of about $30 or so. The company initially launched for the leisure market, but they eventually have plans to go into corporate flights. The company just closed an $800,000 round of funding from YC, 500 Startups, Kevin Laws (board member at AngelList), Matt Dickinson (early investor in Ark), Mick Liubinskas (from Pollenizer), and others.
This startup is tackling the very thorny problem of mobile advertising, which has vexed juggernauts like Facebook and Google because it is much harder to charge rates that are comparable to what is available on the desktop web. Mth Sense says that advertising is not as efficient as it could be because only 1 percent of ads come with any info about the users. Most ads served are blind. Mth sense’s solution adds demographic data to ads through predictive modeling based on app and device usage. For example, if you have the Pinterest, and Vogue apps, you’re more likely to be a soccer mom. The company generates about 10,000 profiles per day with trials seeing 35 to 65 percent click through rate increases. The say they can charge roughly a 4 cent cost-per-1,000-impressions for this data.
In a world where all consumer web products seem to have gone mobile-first, Scoutzie says that there are thousands of people looking for great mobile designers. There are brand agencies that could cost $50,000 and then there are marketplaces like 99Designs, which Scoutzie criticizes for focusing on cheaper labor. Since design is so vital to success of an app, paying $6 an hour is just not going to cut it. Scoutzie community vets all potential designers, either through a formal portfolio review or through a members-only invite process. This review process has resulted in 500 top notch members of the Scoutzie community and around 1,500 applicants who didn’t make the cut. The startup, which monetizes by taking a 10% cut of all projects arranged via the site (versus an agency’s traditional 50% cut), is currently focused on building community feedback tools to encourage its members to feel at home and valued — which even further sets it apart from 99Designs.
Instacart eventually wants to be an Amazon.com with one-hour delivery for anything and everything, but for now, it’s focusing on groceries. The startup says it has delivered thousands of items and orders are doubling weekly. “Every day is the largest day ever,” says founder Apoorva Mehta, who is a former supply chain engineer at Amazon. He made a winking reference to previous failures from the Web 1.0 era including Kozmo and Webvan. Mehta says what makes Instacart different is that it is entirely managed using software. The average order size is $55 and gross margins are 30 percent. He adds that best of all, users find Instacart addictive, with them using it on average 1.2 times per week. The service is now available in just three cities in California, but there are plans to launch in a new city every two weeks.
This startup just launched an instant virtual phone system for small and medium businesses. The service is geared toward companies and individuals looking for a professional phone solution without the cost and hassle of using legacy hardware and software solutions. For just $30 per month, Profig offers its users one toll-free number, two local numbers, 500 minutes of calling time and 250 text messages. The company says a custom call center can cost thousands of dollars to set up. A “holy grail” of phone system would be one that’s eight times cheaper than legacy phone systems, with a sales call center, a support center, customer advertising, all available in a single dashboard in the browser. Profig now has 62 businesses on its network and acquired all of them organically. The company says that its target market is worth more than $25 billion per year.
This startup makes it easy for businesses to automate common tasks on the web and sync data between different web apps. It recently announced the launch of its third-party developer platform. The company says the mass migration toward cloud-based services and a wealth of new web APIs have made it harder for services to connect with other applications. Zapier says its service acts as a hub and spoke for all of these different pieces.
From a Thiel 20-Under-20 fellow, the Coco is a case for your phone that provides all the tactile buttons you need for gaming. It communicates through the audio jack, so there’s no battery needed, no syncing required, no Bluetooth necessary. Ic can be sold for the price of normal phone case at a similar margin. The company says it’s already in talks with some of the largest retailers out there and by the holiday season, it should be the hottest gift. Right now, the Coco is a game controller, but if it gains wider distribution, it could become its own platform for new games. It has a central app that works in tandem with the controller. It can also connect to TVs, so the startup speculates that it could be competitive to the X-Boxes and consoles of the world. In the past month alone, the company has signed up 40 games to support the controller.

Collections.me is a file manager connected to the cloud. The company says that there are more than 1 billion PCs in the world and every one comes with a file manager like Finder. Ten years ago, that was all you needed because files were housed on your computer. But now with cloud apps, those old file managers don’t cut it anymore. The “Collections” native app lives on your computer or mobile phone. The startup says it’s super fast and always available whether you’re online or offline. Launched in beta testing four weeks ago, the app has seen 8,000 downloads, and found five million documents and photos. The company has a freemium model and will charge for enterprise support and premium services. They say it could replace Finder on a Mac or the equivalent on a PC and become the one app that everyone uses to access their digital content.
This startup says it’s “going to eat ” a $150 billion-a-year market in the U.S., because this is what trucking brokers make in fees every year. The largest broker in the U.S. alone commands just 2.8 percent of market and last year, they did more than $10 billion in revenue. Trucking is an extremely fragmented marketplace. Brokers connect shippers with truckers, but they don’t know where the trucks actually are. Truckers are also fragmented and dispersed throughout the country through mom-and-pop shops. It can be hard to find a shipment, especially on a return trip. Keychain Logistics knows where the truckers are and says that one in every 500 trucks are already on the platform. They bring visibility into the world of trucking. Keychain takes $168 through $336 per shipment and is already attracting name partners like Tide and Kellogg’s.

This Israeli company says it handles parallel databases, with an initial use case being in massive-multiplayer online gaming. With new kinds of data and new ways of processing it, Parallel says new approaches are needed. But CPUs aren’t moving any faster and concurrency is very hard to do. The company’s first product is an offshoot of the military technology one of the co-founders developed. It offers server-side, in-memory, low-latency, dynamic, concurrent and distributed spatial data-store for 2D and 3D spatial objects. For example, a system that tracks large aircraft should be able to prevent two from colliding immediately. Parallel says its product Spacebase could be applied to self-driving cars or gaming.
Survata’s product replaces paywalls on premium content from online publishers with surveys that conduct market research. They say market research is a $7 billion per year industry. The company launched last month and says it has grown by 30 percent week-over-week in terms of questions answered. But it faces a formidable competitor in Google, which announced a very similar initiative just a few months ago.

A majority of the very largest companies have sponsored trade shows or conferences. Microsoft, for example, spent $30 million on conference sponsorships this year while Pepsico spent more. Sponsorfied says the problem is this market is stuck in the 1990s. It’s fragmented, offline and extremely hard to manage. Sponsorfied says it will centralize the market onto its network for sponsors and do for sponsorship what Google did for advertising. They’ve already done 200 deals with $400,000 in sponsorships and are working with brands like PBR, Popchips, and Red Bull. Two weeks ago, they signed an exclusive deal with a major sports team that sells over $100 million in sponsorships every year.
Filepicker says that web and mobile apps can only work with content on users’ hard drives and can’t access web-based files. Say, if a user wants to edit a photo on Facebook, it has to go back and forth with other applications. But if Facebook and a web app could speak to each other directly, it could be easier. Filepicker provides a single uniform API for developers, so that when they want to upload a file, they can pull them all directly from Facebook, Google Drive, Instagram, Box, and all the other places they have content stored online by just implementing a simple line of code. The startup says that developers love it, because it makes their applications better. The company has seen 20 percent week-over-week growth for last 12 weeks. The platform has 134 apps total, including Scribd, SurveyMonkey and Alfresco, and will be profitable next month.
Referly makes it easy to recommend products and take a commission from affiliate links, potentially opening the world of affiliate revenue to a much larger group of consumers. Users create special links that track whether they’re driving sales to other sites, displayed in a simple, consumer-friendly dashboard, then they take an average of 5 percent commission on those sales.
Since launching in May, the company says it has signed up 30,000 merchants and generated more than $100,000 in sales. You can also donate your earnings to charity. And last month, Referly launched an API that should allow any site to have a referral program. Read more about Referly.
Rent.io says it wants to “optimize pricing of the single biggest recurring expense in lives of 100 million Americans.” Apartment owners are losing tens of billions of dollars because they don’t have accurate pricing information, the company says — so it assesses the revenue potential of a property for those owners. Customers pay $25 per apartment per year. The company launched two weeks ago, and it says there are now 15,000 apartments in the system.

Editor’s note: Jay Jamison is a Partner at BlueRun Ventures and is based in Menlo Park. He focuses on early stage mobile, consumer and enterprise opportunities, and he serves on the boards of AppCentral (acquired by Good Technology), AppRedeem, Foodspotting, and Thumb. You can follow him on his blog and on Twitter.
In August, I wrote about how the Mobile Era was upon us and how the Mobile Wave was impacting Facebook and Zynga. I wrote about how mobile represented a big shift, and the giants of the social web needed to show that they could jump onto this wave or risk being disrupted.
Wall Street is basically demanding big public tech companies to answer the question, “How mobile can you go?” And based on a read of the big tech companies’ recent Q3 earnings reports, they all got the memo. Here’s my take on their mobile strategies.
First up, Facebook had a busy quarter, having welcomed its billionth member. Where was mobile in Facebook’s earnings announcement? At the very top, Facebook co-founder and CEO, Mark Zuckerberg was on mobile about 10 seconds in to his remarks. And his prioritization and story was so clear, simple and strong that any fifth grader could understand it, let alone Wall Street analysts. To summarize his pitch, mobile enables Facebook to reach way more people. Mobile Facebook users open Facebook more frequently—mobile users are 70 percent likely to open Facebook on a given day, versus 40 percent if you’re a PC-only Facebook user. And with the recent launch of Facebook’s native iOS app, Zuckerberg showed that time and engagement on mobile Facebook was increasing.
More users, more engagement, more money. Simple. On top of that, they’ve ditched HTML5 for a native iOS app that rocks. The Instagram acquisition has closed (and quadrupled users to >100 million), and has more traffic than Twitter on mobile in the U.S.
With nearly $57 billion in current assets on its balance sheet, a horde as large as Apple’s and nearing Microsoft’s, Google is, in poker parlance, one of the big stacks, sitting behind a mountain of chips. And with a big wall of chips in poker, there are basically two strategies. One, hang back, play safe, and let weaker players beat themselves up. Or two, get even more aggressive, making big, audacious bets that, if wrong, could hurt but also raise the bar on the competition. Google’s clearly chosen the aggressive route. Purchase Motorola Mobility. Drive Android to unit share leadership. And waiting in the wings, Google Glass, which could well be the breakthrough product of this decade.
Wall Street dinged Google’s most recent announcement, fretting about the continuing integration challenge of Motorola Mobility and worrying about the lower per-unit economics of Google’s mobile ad revenue.  I’m more bullish long-term. Integrating a hardware company like Motorola Mobility into an Internet company like Google is a big challenge. Totally different cultures, timelines, etc., but at the end of the day, I don’t see the integration as make or break.
Monetizing mobile ad revenue is, however, make or break. And getting to an $8 billion run rate on mobile alone (nearly double of Yahoo!’s entire revenue in 2011), shows that Google knows a bit about monetizing mobile. More broadly, with the assets it has in place — Android, Chrome, maps, its ad products, etc. — Google is positioned well. While it might take some time to bring per-unit economics on mobile in line with the web, with the elements of location, real-time, always on/always connected nature of mobile, I’m bullish on Google in our mobile future.
And what’d Microsoft have to say about its mobile future in its earnings announcements last week? With the coordinated launches of the Windows 8 platform (for PCs and tablets), Windows Phone 8, and the new Microsoft Surface, it’s getting into the game in a manner that suits its strength as the central point of the PC ecosystem.  Microsoft’s advantage has always been its broad ecosystem — from chipset manufacturers (Intel, AMD), hardware OEMs and peripheral makers to software developers — that could create a vast array of product offerings and price points. A PC on every desk and in every home, with a broad selection of printers, scanners, joysticks, and software that usually basically work. And this worked great, until consumers started getting way more mobile, and smartphones and tablets exploded onto the scene.
As a former owner of both an HP-based PocketPC from Microsoft in the late 90s and an HP-based Microsoft Windows Tablet 10 years ago, I’m perplexed regarding where Microsoft finds itself in mobile today. It’s not like it didn’t try to get there 10 years ago. It did. The offerings just weren’t good enough.
And that’s really the key question this time around: Are the offerings good enough? Despite the very cool look and feel of Metro, XBOX Music, etc, it’s too soon to call the future one way or another here. Will consumers adopt en mass? Will developers look to and start developing against Windows 8? Will the vast bulk of the profit pool of laptops, tablets and mobile continue to get hoovered up by Apple, Google, and Amazon? No wonder Microsoft called Windows 8 the most important launch since Windows 95!
If the always amazing, always innovative ecommerce leader were a sports team, I’d compare it to the New England Patriots. Both are innovative, consistent, and winners. And listening to an Amazon earnings call is like listening to a press conference of New England Patriots Head Coach Bill Bellicheck. Both are great at responding to questions with answers that don’t really say anything concrete about how things are going.  When asked on the earnings call about how the Kindles are selling, Amazon SVP & CFO, Tom Szutak basically says, yep, we’re selling a lot of them, and yep, users are consuming content through them. That’s Classic Bellicheck.
Similar to Apple, Amazon understood very early and executed on great bets that the shift to mobile represented a great opportunity for commerce. For Amazon, these Kindles are like mini checkout terminals for its massive digital storefront. Cha-ching. So remaining focused on driving unit share of the Kindle devices and the storefront is a great offensive strategy.
With a market cap as large as Microsoft, Amazon, and Google combined, Apple is the super heavyweight of the bunch. The initial reaction on Apple’s earnings announcement is that growth is slowing and there’s concern around cannibalization of the iPad with the iPad Mini. Also there was hand-wringing on declining gross margins.
I’m not worried about this stuff. If I were an Apple exec, I’d be laser focused on how to continue to drive market share in tablets for a few reasons. First, the tablet market continues to explode. Indeed, in a recent presentation, Kleiner Perkins Caufield Byers general partner Mary Meeker forecast Q2 2013 as the date when the installed base of smartphones plus tablets will surpass the installed base of PCs. Second, tablets will continue to be great consumption devices, with users purchasing books, movies, music, TV shows, apps, and all kinds of stuff that Apple provides seamlessly and profitably. So Apple has a lot of strategic interest in continuing to drive market share leadership in this category, even at the expense of short-term gross margin pressure.
Critics may argue that if there were any clouds on Apple’s very broad, cash-rich horizons, it’d be the question of the company’s next big thing — a TV perhaps? While this critique may sound too “what have you done for me lately?” keep in mind this industry moves fast. Apple owned the last decade, with the iPod/iTunes, the iPhone, and the iPad. But winning last decade doesn’t necessarily assure anything (just ask RIM). Given the time Apple spent in the wilderness, it very likely understands this better than most.
Apple is working on a next big innovation. They’re just keeping it a secret.
Trying to get out of the wilderness is Yahoo, which stunned the tech world with the hiring of Marissa Mayer as CEO. If you want to get out of a hole, stop digging. Hire Mayer.
Yahoo’s Q3 earnings call was notable as the first for Mayer in the CEO chair. A slight beat of expectations led to a nice bump in the stock. And listening to Mayer, it’s pretty clear that she’s got a crisp idea of the strategy and execution Yahoo needs. But she also realizes that job No. 1, namely getting the leadership, culture and team set up for success at Yahoo, has to be her core focus. The leadership vacuum and churn that preceded here had an impact.
Mayer has an extraordinary track record as a product executive. In reading her remarks in full, she sees opportunity at Yahoo around search, mobile and elsewhere. Her pointing out that Yahoo has 76 different applications on iOS and Android underscores this. I thought this comment was also spot on:
As the world becomes increasingly mobile, the way we all consume content has dramatically shifted. Interestingly, when you look at the most frequent uses of smartphones, they include checking the weather, checking sports scores, checking stock quotes and other financial information, watching videos, sharing photos, getting the latest news and playing games. Does that sound like any particular company that you know?
So Mayer clearly gets mobile and the prioritization at Yahoo here is likely high. When you read her comments more broadly, however, you do realize that she’s still up to her arms in terms of getting the culture and the team right. She points out in her comments that in business the best teams win.  Great start. There is till work to do. Stay tuned.
Here is how I would score if I were going to invest purely based on these companies’ mobile strategies:
Buy: Facebook, Google, Amazon, Apple; wait and see: Microsoft, Yahoo. As to what it means for the mobile-centric startup community:
The war for mobile talent will continue. Mobile developers are in crazy demand these days. With the ever-increasing focus on mobile by all these companies, this war will continue. I’d expect that we’ll continue to see these large public companies being active in M&A activities, especially to bolster their mobile talent.
Leveraging native across different platforms is a huge plus. Facebook walked away from HTML5 and released an awesome iOS app, with Android coming. Although there is tremendous potential and excitement around HTML5, it seems crazy to not follow Facebook’s lead. User expectation on the quality and responsiveness of mobile apps really demands that you go native. With the increasing share we’re seeing in Android (and with the growth of Kindle), mobile companies that can crank out and innovate across iOS and Android have a lot of potential.
Anticipate growing opportunity in tablets. Apple CEO Tim Cook is on the record consistently and over time with the vision that tablets will overtake PCs. And we’re going to see an explosion of devices, on iOS, Android and Windows. As tablets go more and more mainstream, I’d anticipate opportunities for new disrupters to enter, leveraging the browsing and discovery experience available there. There’ve been great generation 1 tablet-centric apps—Flipboard, Pulse, and other emerging companies like Pickie. But I think we’re only just getting started here.
Stay tuned for more big moves by the big players. It was once unthinkable for Microsoft to build its own PC-hardware; now it has the Surface. Similarly, it was hard to visualize Google choosing to buy Motorola Mobility to crank out mobile devices. Who knows what’s next? There’ve been rumors of Amazon planning a smartphone and Apple releasing a mind-blowing next-gen television. I forecast that this will be an era of big steps by big players. No one can really afford to sit back.
 Thrilling times indeed.

Well, Facebook shareholders sure like the sound of Gifts.
Around Wall Street’s close yesterday, the company launched a much anticipated e-commerce initiative that lets Facebook users send real, physical gifts to friends and family on birthdays and special events like engagements and weddings. It gives the company a third business model beyond advertising and payments revenue. Shares have jumped by 6.6 percent today to $21.66.
So what could Gifts mean for Facebook’s bottom line? Let’s do some guesswork. The company has 165.7 million users in the U.S., according to the ads tool. Let’s say between 2 and 6 percent actually convert and pay (which is standard for a Facebook game or app), and each of those consumers buys two gifts a year at roughly $30 each. That’s between $200 million and $600 million in additional revenue. But you’d have to take out whatever the costs of the goods are and Facebook didn’t disclose its revenue share. If they had Amazon’s gross margins, which are between 20 and 25 percent and are probably much higher than Facebook’s, they would have somewhere between $45 million and $140 million in additional gross profit.
Considering that Facebook earned $1 billion in net income on $3.7 billion in revenue last year, this would be a small bump in profit for the company. But don’t forget the holiday quarter, where Christmas and Hanukkah could add a nice seasonal boost to gifting revenues.
The other thing to keep in mind is that Gifts will allow Facebook to collect tens of millions of more credit cards from users, which will lead to other future revenue streams. The company disclosed in its IPO filing that just 15 million users bought its virtual currency Credits last year. Apple, in contrast, has 435 million iTunes accounts, so that company’s database of payments information on customers is at least an order of magnitude larger than Facebook’s.
Before Gifts, Facebook used to accumulate credit card data on its users primarily through games and virtual goods purchases. But games, while extremely popular, aren’t a universal use case on the site. Gifts may help on-board a broader base of consumers onto Facebook’s payments system. And honestly, a 2 to 6 percent conversion may frankly be a little low for the the program especially because it gets such premium billing and promotion in the top right-hand corner of the home page. The more payments data Facebook has on its users, the more seamless it will be for consumers to buckle and buy physical or virtual goods through the Facebook platform.
On top of that, the information that Facebook collects about gifts that people want to give or receive could help with advertising targeting. Facebook launched Gifts after acquiring Karma, a mobile gifting app founded by Lee Linden and Ben Lewis, who previously sold Tapjoy to Offerpal.

Smartphones and tablets maker HTC this morning said it foresees a huge drop in revenue (PDF) in the first quarter, citing “short-term difficulties” as it gears up to – reportedly – launch four new phone models at the Mobile World Congress later this month.
The Taiwanese company sees revenue dropping as much as 36 percent in Q1, to between NT$65 billion and NT$70 billion (roughly $2.2 and $2.4 billion) due to this “product transition”.
In PR speak, that sound something like this:
Despite short-term difficulties, momentum will resume in the upcoming product cycle driven by HTC’s brand strength, innovation, and design/engineering capabilities
The smartphone maker also said it expected gross margin to come in at around 25 percent, and operating margin at 7.5 percent, which is down from 27.1 percent and 12.7 percent in the previous quarter. Again, HTC says it expects these margins to “normalize” after the debut of the new phones.
In other words, HTC has a heck of a lot riding on these new smartphones selling like hotcakes, as it feels the pressure from Apple’s overwhelming iPhone success and an increasing number of manufacturers churning out and selling competing Android-powered devices by the millions.

After ending regular trading all but flat today, Intel is up 5.47 percent after-hours on the strength of new guidance for its second quarter and full-year revenue, and a slight change to its gross margin.
For the second quarter, Intel expects revenue of $13.7 billion, plus or minus $300 million. This is greater than its prior expectation of $13 billion, plus or minus $500 million. So, on the top and bottom, Intel could see revenue of $14 billion in the second quarter, up from its lowest prior guidance band of $12.5 billion.
According to Yahoo Finance, consensus forecast for the quarter’s revenue was $13.02 billion, and Intel will beat that handily.
For the full year, Intel now expects its revenue to grow, up from expectations that it would be flat. Gross margins are also expected to bump up 1 percent to a “mid-point” 64 percent.
What’s driving the better-than-expected top line for Intel? “[S]tronger than expected demand for business PCs,” according to the company.
I reached out to Microsoft for its thoughts on the business PC market, and it pointed me to its last quarter results, particularly the following quote from its CFO, Amy Hood:
“Businesses are clearly expressing their overwhelming preference for Windows. Windows Pro revenue grew 19 percent driven by growth in business PCs, mix shift to developed markets where attach is higher, continued strength in the enterprise, and an increased mix of Pro in small and medium businesses.  Windows Volume Licensing also had a solid 11 percent revenue growth.”
Put another way: The Windows XP death march continues.
As The Next Web’s Emil Protalinski noted recently, Windows 7 recently scooted back past the 50% market share mark. Why would Windows 7 pick up new market share, this far into the Windows 8.x era? Businesses are getting the heck off of Windows XP and picking Windows 7 over 8.x.
That’s not much of a knock against Windows 8.x, as Microsoft previously encouraged companies that were working on a transition to Windows 7 to keep at it, and not switch mid-stream to 8.x. Enterprise market share for XP has fallen below 10 percent, according to Qualys, so how long this momentum can last isn’t clear.
XP’s death march will induce many businesses to buy machines running Windows 7. Intel’s chips power most of those machines, so the sales will be a boon for the chipmaker. Even though WinTel is a past era, what’s good for the PC market is still good for both Microsoft and Intel. Rumors of the death of PCs have at least been modestly exaggerated.

It’s no secret that many deals have been struck and key relationships formed at TechCrunch founder Michael Arrington’s former house in Atherton. In case you aren’t familiar, Arrington threw epic parties at his home for the tech community in the early days of TechCrunch. Police were called, booze was flowing, people passed out. I don’t have enough fingers to count how many times I’ve spoken to a Silicon Valley entrepreneur or VC who said he or she used to frequent Mike’s house parties back in the day. Clearly this was the place to be for anyone looking to meet their next investor, acquirer, co-founder etc.
And that’s exactly what Box co-founders Dylan Smith and Aaron Levie were thinking when they showed up to Mike’s house in early February 2006 for the Naked Conversations TechCrunch Party. It was in Mike’s backyard where they met then Draper Fisher Jurvetson partner Emily Melton. Beers in hand (actually only Levie was of age-barely, so Smith was drinking water), the pair pitched Melton on their idea. She was so impressed and their passion for what they were building cloud storage, that she immediately introduced them to the DFJ partner covering SaaS and enterprise investments, Josh Stein, who months later led Box’s first round of institutional investment.
Smith and Levie credit this meeting as one of the key turning points for Box to become what it is now—a close to billion dollar enterprise cloud storage company with 11 million users, 80 percent of the Fortune 500 as customers, and $162 million in funding. In the company’s latest funding round in the Fall of 2011, the company was valued somewhere above $600 million, a number that could easily have jumped in the past 9 months. While two teenagers starting a tech company out of a garage isn’t that unique in the Silicon Valley world, Smith and Levie’s ability to create a valuable product from thousands of dollars, and instilling confidence in well-known VCs and companies is.
From Research Paper To Funding
The idea for Box originated from a research project that Levie, who was then a college student at USC, was working on in 2004. Levie’s project examined storage options and in the process of researching his paper he discovered how fragmented the market was. He called up 10 random businesses and asked how they are storing content and data and received ten different answers. Back then, Levie realized in his research that even though there were no iPhones, tablets or Android phones, people still wanted to access data from different places. These places just happened to be extinct technologies now, he adds, joking that the Palm Trio was back then a prime destination to find documents.
“The opportunity I saw was to build something that would change how you want to get your information,” he explains. At the time, many thought Gmail would be sufficient for storing data. But Levie felt there was a real business behind where to store data and this was in the cloud. The name Box came from his vision of storing data in a virtual box in the cloud.
During the Winter Break of 2004, Levie shared his idea with Smith. Both Smith and Levie had toyed around with startups in the past and had dreams of starting their own companies. The boys shared Levie’s passion for the cloud storage idea and by the Spring of 2005, Levie, Smith and his friends were actually developing a product. Box, at the time, was simply an online file storage service where users could pay to store files in the cloud.
This was all happening in between classes, says Smith, who was enrolled at Duke, and in order to fund the early days of Box in 2005, Smith invested $20,000 of money he earned playing online poker. The team actually launched the product in February of 2005 as a simple file storage product for both consumers and enterprises. Levie and Smith sent their pitches to the media and landed coverage on sites like Gizmodo, where they offered free storage incentives for new customers. The fledgling startup quickly accumulated a few customers and began its journey as a real service.
In the summer of 2005, Levie, Smith and the team housed themselves in Smith’s parents’ attic in Seattle and worked on accumulating more customers and developing the product. Smith’s younger brother did tech support, Levie said, and he and Smith tried to raise additional financing in Seattle. But this proved to be challenging at the time. “Seattle was lacking the Silicon Valley-Zuckerberg story. VCs and angels in Seattle were still repairing wounds from the Dot.com bust.”
Smith and Levie decided to take their roadshow national and began contacting angel investors outside of Seattle. One of those investors was Mark Cuban. Levie cold-called Cuban via email about Box, and got a response from the entrepreneur immediately. In the Fall of 2005, Cuban decided to put in $350,000.
Around the same time, Box was scaling fast and it got to the point where Levie and Smith realized that they could no longer attend school and manage the day-to-day activities of Box. Both Levie and Smith approached their parents about dropping out of college in December of 2005. While both Levie and Smith’s parents were supportive, Smith says he his mom was a little bit concerned about throwing the education away. It took some convincing, says Smith, but in the end he promised he would go back and earn the degree at some point.
Once the decision was made to leave their respective colleges, Aaron (then 21) and Smith (then 20) mutually agreed that Silicon Valley was the best place to be. The pair packed their bags and moved to Berkeley, California in early 2006, where Levie’s uncle rented them a small garage. As Smith recalled,  both Levie and him  worked and lived night and day out of the garage, soon joined by high school friends from Mercer Island, Jeff Queisser and Sam Ghods.
As for the product, Levie and Smith began to brainstorm ways in which to get the service to go viral, and decided to open up the file storage service for free. Smith says this was a key turning point for the company, which began soliciting customers with little sales efforts. In fact, Box was getting so much traffic that servers were breaking down. But in terms of the vision, Box was still a consumer and business company. As Levie explains users “interpreted what they were doing with Box in their own individual way. Some people thought it was backup, others found it a way to replace emails,” he says.
Then came that fateful Spring day at Arrington’s house, where Levie and Smith pitched Melton on their company. The boys had already decided they needed to raise a round, and were attempting to make connections with investors on Sand Hill Road, but the in with Stein at DFJ was able to speed up the process.
Stein recalls in one of his first meetings at Smith and Levie’s Berkeley garage, he had to step over enormous mound of stinky laundry, and was legitimately worried about the boys’ health in garage. But besides the pungent odor, he was immediately struck by how impressive the product was for a bootstrapped startup. “You could tell right away that this was a company that was very product-focused. Coming off the heels of storage failures of Xdrive, Aaron had come up with differentiated and distinctive vision for what product should do, what it should look like.” And what also impressed him was Dylan’s detailed insight into the startup’s business operations despite his youth.
At the first meeting, Stein peppered both Smith and Levie with questions about the company, business model and more. By 2 a.m. the next morning, Stein received a multi-page response from the team with thoughtful, detailed responses to each questions. He saw this as a good sign. “There was an intelligence, an energy and drive in Aaron and Dylan that was immediately apparent. That’s not always the case int he valley,” he says.
And when evaluating whether to invest in the company, he thought that the product served a definite purpose in the business world, but had what he called “modest aspirations,” for Box. DFJ signed off on the investment and by July 2006, terms sheets were signed and Box had raised $1.5 million from the firm.
Consumer To Enterprise
Interestingly, it was Stein who helped define a set vision for the company in its early days. Box, at its start, was focused on both consumers and businesses, offering a dead simple way to store files. In 2006, the company continued to iterate on both sides of the business, launching file sharing options for consumers and businesses. But Stein, who was an active part of Box’s business (and served on the board), saw the writing on the wall that enterprise customers were “stickier,” in his words, and pushed the company to “sharpen its focus.”
Even Levie admits that he didn’t grasp how large and substantial the enterprise opportunity was until Stein started pitching him and Smith on a more targeted product. He explains, “Josh Stein started to connect the dots on doing an SaaS enterprise model. We credit him to being able to shine light for us on something we couldn’t see.”
The company began tailoring the product towards business users around 2007, and as Stein says, “engagement went through the roof.”
Another added feature which helped boost enterprise use was security, which was added in 2008. The company found that businesses were willing to pay even more for added security and permissioning. While not the sexiest product feature, the ability to have administrative control over data was really a turning point for product, says Stein. The addition of admin controls and security played into the needs of big companies, and CIOs started to actually pay attention to Box.
It was these offerings that caught the attention of Justin Slaten, Director, Information Technology for Wasserman Media in 2007. “There were lot of companies popping up at time that were consumer facing products in file storage but weren’t focused on the enterprise,” he says. “Box was the first company that was willing to offer a product that focused on business users.”
Nearly six years later, Wasserman is still using Box (along with Procter And Gamble, Pandora, Skype, LinkedIn, Turner and many others). Slaten says that Box is “in tune” with what clients want in a user experience, whether that be collaboration, apps or security. “They are always deploying features that I actually want,” he says.
By 2008, the company still had just a handful of employees but Levie and Smith were both settling into their defined roles within the business, with Levie as CEO and Smith as CFO. As Stein explains, the founders’ strengths were complimentary from the beginning. “Aaron is focused more on the product, design and technology part of the business and Dylan is drawn to the economics and business model. These defined skill sets allowed them to focus on building business and think about it holistically.”
Not only did Smith and Levie work days and nights together, but they were also room mates and actually lived at the offices until 2008. The company eventually moved to Palo Alto shortly after the DFJ funding round, and the Smith and Levie took a loft above the office, which had just a few mattresses on the floor.
Living and working together usually doesn’t work for most founders, especially when they are actually sharing a bedroom. But Smith explains that they developed systems early on to be able to live with each other, calling Levie more of a brother than a friend.
From A Berkeley Garage To A $600 Million-Plus Dollar Business
As competitors started popping up in 2007 and 2008, Box focused on strengthening its enterprise product even further. Box steadily evolved into more than just a file storage platform, becoming a full-fledged collaborative application where businesses can actually communicate about document updates, sync files remotely, and even add features from Salesforce, Google Apps, NetSuite, Yammer and others. Mobile is another area where Box has been focusing, adopting HTML5, launching iPhone, iPad and Android apps and more.

Along the way, Box realized the market was much bigger than file storage. As it evolved into a collaboration platform, the company realized the enormous opportunity in providing a simple, cloud-based alternative to legacy systems like  Microsoft Sharepoint. The company began aggressively campaigning for existing Sharepoint users to make the switch.
Stein says that in 2009, he realized that Box was going to be a multibillion company. “You could see acceleration of taking off. In 2010, the company doubled the amount of sales reps selling the product to businesses and sales and productivity skyrocketed.”
Around the same time, Box raised $15 million on Series C funding from Scale Venture Partners, DFJ and U.S. Venture Partners. A year later, Box landed $48 million in new funding from Meritech Capital Partners, Andreessen Horowitz, Emergence Capital Partners, DFJ, Scale Venture Partners and US Venture Partners.
And then the acquisition offers started coming in. As reported last year, the company fielded a $600 million acquisition offer from Citrix, exactly 6 years after raising $350,000 from Mark Cuban.
While Levie tends to shy away from commenting on the acquisition, we heard from sources that it was a hard decision to say no to. There was a lot of money to be made, and it was a risk to keep pushing forward as an independent company.
“I think you get these opportunities once every decade where such a massive change is happening in the landscape that enables a startup to be at the center,” says Levie. “And there is a lot of pressure to make sure you build something successful when making the decisions to stay independent.”
When making the decision to turn down the acquisition, Levie and Smith both had the sense that Box’s story wasn’t finished. The company was still growing rapidly, churn rates were down, and customers were actually renewing for additional  paid plans, all leading to a healthy, fast-growing top line.
Turning down the acquisition was a very clarifying experience for both investors and Box’s founders because it set a clear goal for the company. The expectation was at the time was that if Box stayed independent, the company was going to really go for it, with the goal of eventually becoming a public company.
At that point, it made sense for Box to raise another round, with this one totaling $81 million. Investors included Salesforce.com, SAP Ventures, Bessemer Venture Partners, NEA, Andreessen Horowitz and DFJ.
As for going public, Levie says that inevitably employees and investors will desire liquidity and being a public company afford this opportunity.
Stein echoes Levie’s thoughts, and believes the company is in a prime position to be a public company. “Enterprise SaaS companies are perfectly suited to be public companies. The company’s gross margins are north of 70 percent and there’s recurring revenue, which is great for the public markets,” he explains. “I think Box is the kind of company we see once every decade at DFJ. I compare it to Salesforce but I think Box is actually creating an even larger category of enterprise software. I think it has the potential to be the next email; basically what company intranets are supposed to be.” he says.
As for revenue, Box is on track to triple revenue in 2012. Last year, Box reportedly brought in around $25 million in revenue, so we’re looking at a $75 million-plus sales number for 2012. Smith adds that the company is growing faster than they ever have in the past.
The Enterprise Culture And The Competition
Running an enterprise company presents its own unique challenges. Levie says one of his biggest challenges is developing easy to use products for businesses, and iterating fast, despite being an enterprise company. “Our engineers have to be consumer internet minds, our products have to be consumer minded, we have to move fast but build software like an enterprise company,” he says.
Levie explains that each week, Box re-releases the site with fixes. He compares this to the yearly cycle for products builds for on-premise companies. But he sees the rapid product iteration of consumer focused companies like Facebook, as the future of enterprise and cloud.
“IBM, Oracle and Microsoft are always going to respond more slowly to market. They haven’t developed a rapid release product development strategy. So how we compete is moving more quickly, and being more agile. We can reach and get end users faster than the bigger player. The next generation of enterprise software companies will be organizations built like consumer internet companies that happen to sell to businesses,” Levie comments.
But the challenge to producing fast, and adding features is taking business customers off guard as well as education. For us to flip a feature through quickly, it has to be additive, Levie says. “We can’t impair the customer’s processes and this is a constant tension.”
Competition has also come recently from Google with the launch of the search giant’s own storage product, Google Drive. Levie doesn’t seem to be too worried to call Google a competitor. “I can’t think of a single startup that won’t have Google as a competitor. For same reason Oracle could never build a great consumer product, I think it is hard for companies like Google to be a leader in the enterprise.”
Another challenge, though unsurprising, is hiring, particularly in engineering and sales. As Box’s COO Dan Levin explains, the company needs to find people who are not only good at their job but also reinforce the entrepreneurial, product-driven, fast-paced culture at Box. He says that Box roughly phone screens 100 people to find ten to interview on site to make 1 to 2 offers.
And Box is continuing to staff up. Levie says the company is looking to boost headcount by 50-75 percent by the end of the year. Currently, Box has 425 employees and just moved to new headquarters in Palo Alto.
The Future
Levie recalls pitching Marc Andreessen a few years ago on investing in the company’s Series D round. He had put up growth projections and goals for Box, and while Andreessen said this data was positive, he asked Levie a thought-provoking question. “How fast does the storage market have to grow to get to these goals?” It’s a question that Levie continually repeats to himself when making projections for the future of Box.
Levie sees Box’s future particularly centralized around creating an ecosystem of apps both on mobile and web platforms. Last fall, Box launched a platform for developers building off of the Box platform, called the Box Innovation Network (/bin). And earlier this year, we learned about Box OneCloud, a mobile cloud and API for the enterprise that allows businesses to access, edit, and share content from their mobile devices.
Box is also looking to use data to help businesses make better business decisions. And adding new applications to the Box platform helps bring more data into the collaboration flow. “We want Box to be the foundation for storage, permissions, collaboration, security, with horizontal apps built on top of the service. We think we can be an important broker for applications to generate business and demand,” says Levie.
Smith adds that Box also plans to build data centers in additional countries in the world, and sees international markets as a huge growth area for the company.
A few years shy of their thirtieth birthdays, Smith and Levie are at the helm of one of the fastest growing enterprise startups in the technology world. And the company is fast approaching a billion valuation, if it hasn’t reached that already. Box’s story isn’t an overnight success but more of a testament to the strength of having two, passion-driven founders who weren’t afraid to cold-call well-known investors, drop out of college to live the startup dream, and squander thousands in poker winnings on a fledgling idea.

In a bizarre amalgamation of virtual and physical business, the dying independent  terrestrial turned internet radio station WOXY is being revived by online CD swapping service Lala.  Lala is tangible evidence that online music doesn’t have to kill the CD industry.  At first I was skeptical, but after spending more time on the site I think this radio strategy is very smart.  See also our previous coverage of the company here.
Lala users identify CDs they want mailed to them for $1 plus 75 cents shipping. Other users who have those CDs available for swapping are notified and put them in the mail.  Lala keeps the dollar and donates a portion of it (as much as $50k in a month so far) to a Foundation that supports artists.  Users can also chose to purchase CDs for immediate delivery.
Now the company is taking over WOXY to allow users to create streaming radio stations that will in turn inspire CD swapping and purchases.  Station listeners can click to request a swapped or purchased CD that a streaming track originates from.  The music available for creating the radio stations is licensed from a third party.   Lala plans to invest between $5 and $10 million into the station.  The company received $9 million in funding from Bain and Ignition last year.
It appears that Lala is quickly gaining traction with users. The company reports about 10,000 CD swapping transactions per day.   Comments left on the site appear in numbers that many publishers would be envious of.  The company says CD sales have been doubling monthly and hit gross margin profitability last month.  Only 2% of CD swapping transactions result in complaint reports and users are rated in a karma system.
Perhaps the strangest thing about Lala is a delusional, yet legally required, request that participants delete digital copies of music from the CDs they mail away in swaps.  I’d be curious to see how often that happens.
Internet radio licenses open a number of interesting, if legally tricky, possibilities like this.  See also Faces.com, (our coverage) an Australia based social network that combines user playlists, online music sales and an internet radio license.  (Disclosure: Faces is a TechCrunch sponsor.)  See also our coverage of Swaptree if trading physical objects is your thing.
I think I like Lala, though the integration of CD swapping, music purchase, internet radio and DRM compliance is taking a while for me to wrap my brain around.  Apparently that’s not the case with Lala’s growing user base though.  This is definitely a company to watch.

Dell is on the market for some profitable companies but Acer isn’t one of their targets. In case you didn’t hear, Acer is almost ready to take away the #2 PC maker spot from Dell, but that doesn’t concern Mr. College-Dropout-Dell.
Bloomberg,
Acer “might have a similar unit volume to Dell, but their gross margin dollars are six to seven times less than Dell, and I wouldn’t swap our business with theirs under any circumstance,” he said. “We’re focused on profit share, not market share.”
Dell is hunting around for more acquisitions like the 2007 $1.4 billion purchase of EqualLogic Inc. that helped boost margins and increased revenue about 60 percent. Purchasing Acer, who owns the brands eMachines, Gateway, Packard Bell, E-TEN, Glofiish, would likely increase the market share for Dell considerably, but not necessarily make shareholders more money. So there is no reason to fret if you’re an Acer fanboy, Dell isn’t interest.

You think you have it bad, Mr.-Silicon-Valley-entrepreneur-trolling-Sand-Hilll-Road-for-cash? Try life on the other side of the pond.
Out of 39 firms that were active investors in British start-ups over the last five years, only thirteen venture firms have £5 million or more left in their coffers to invest, according to NESTA, the UK agency that advocates for start-ups and also sponsored the recent Traveling Geeks blogger tour.
That’s right: All but thirteen firms in the United Kingdom are either completely tapped out or have committed the rest of their funds for follow-on investments in existing portfolio companies. In total, NESTA estimates there’s about £400 million left that’s uncommitted among the thirteen, with only half of that available for brand-new series A deals. To put that into perspective, there’s roughly the same amount of money in the fund Marc Andreessen just closed than there is for new companies in the entire United Kingdom right now.
This is coinciding with a precipitous drop in UK firms closing on new funds thanks to the global credit crunch. In 2008, only seven firms closed new funds, and NESTA expects fundraising to be even weaker in 2009.
As most people know, I’m a pretty big advocate of the idea that many of the next great high-growth companies will be founded outside of the U.S., but these stats starkly demonstrate a undeniable advantage of being Valley-based. Even when fundraising slows and VCs save bigger reserves than usual for current investments, there are still billions sloshing around to fund new deals. Sure, it’s hard during times like these even in the Valley, but raising venture capital should be hard.
As with most research reports on the venture business, it’s the trend line that’s important to note here. It’s probable that NESTA isn’t counting a firm here or there. But it can’t be too far off. Indeed, the stat explains a lot of the anecdotal evidence that hit me in the face as soon as I arrived in London two weeks ago. Many of the entrepreneurs who’d pitched me on my last visit to London in November have already shuttered their companies and were unsure of what to do next. I have exactly one friend in Silicon Valley who has been forced to that point.
Even the good UK early stage names are struggling to close deals. It took AlertMe—a hot energy home monitoring company that won The TechCrunch Europa for best clean tech company last week—a whopping nine months to raise money almost landing the company in bankruptcy. (Index Ventures and others finally snapped up the deal a few months ago.) “I don’t want to go through that again,” the very polite and British CEO Pilgrim Beart demurred.
It’s that kind of bleak desperation that lead the infamous Paul Carr to pronounce the UK Internet scene dead….just before his own column in the Guardian became its own victim of the economy a few days later. (See Mr. Butcher’s TechCrunchEurope rebuttal here.)
Indeed “the scene” may be dead, but there’s an upside here. The companies that are still around have a much greater emphasis than Valley companies on making money. The Traveling Geek contingent went to Accel’s London office to meet with a handful of start-ups, and each one emphasized revenue and profits in their five-minute elevator pitches.
One that caught me by surprise was Michael Smith’s Moshi Monsters, a social network/ virtual game for kids. Cute idea, but sounds like it should be road kill in this environment, right? Nope. Its revenues are growing 35% month-over-month, it has 85% gross margins, and just five months after launching the site is cash flow positive. Nicely done, gents. (BTW, Smith isn’t all business. His house was the setting of those famous Scoble pictures…)
Indeed, there’s always something healthy about startups having to work within constraints. There will be fewer of them, but it’s possible that the companies that make it in this environment could well make up one of the most promising crops of UK companies we’ve ever seen. After all, Skype was laughed out of VCs’ offices when it started in the wake of the dot com bust.
In the coming days, I’ll be writing several more posts about the London companies that impressed me the most. Stay tuned.

The idea of a life recorder that captures every moments of your life on video is still a bit of a tech fantasy, but an early version of the life recorder already exists.  It is called Evernote, the popular iPhone (and now Android) app which lets you record your memories by snapping geo-tagged photos, making voice notes, or just text notes and making it easy to search through them.  Evernote does not yet support video recording other than as an attachment (for premium subscribers), but when that becomes more practical it will.
“Evernote is definitely positioned to be the lifelogging tool of choice,” says CEO Phil Libin.  “That ambient video capture was my original plan for Evernote—always recording, not storing, you bookmark it—that is exactly what we want to do.”  Next year Evernote will introduce voice search, which will be a big step towards that ultimate vision (if you can search audio, you can search through what was said in videos).  But full life recording is still a few years out.  For now, Libin is more focussed on polishing his current product as it enters the mainstream.
Evernote just reached 2 million unique users, only 7 months after reaching its first million.  It took Evernote half the time (233 days) to get to the second million milestone than it did the first million (433 days).  These numbers are total unique logins over the life of the service.
The more interesting numbers are the number of active users over the past 30 days, which has also doubled to 700,000 from 360,000 since last May.  Those users have created a total of 76 million notes, up from 36 million in May.  But most importantly, the number of premium paid subscribers has gone from about 14,000 in May to 35,000.  Premium members get more storage and features for $45 a year. The conversion rate for premium subscribers is also going up.  Evernote is converting 4.9 percent of monthly active users to premium accounts, up from a 3.75 percent conversion rate seven months ago.
Unlike most apps, which see sharp drop-offs after only a few months, the longer someone stays on Evernote, the more likely they are to but a premium subscription.  In the first month after signing up, about 50 to 60 percent of people drop off and only 0.5 percent sign up for a premium membership.  But after the first month, retention stabilizes, and by the time people are using Evernote for 12 months, the conversion rate becomes 2 percent, and 6 percent for those on the service for 18 months (and that’s counting all those drop-offs in the first few weeks, the conversion rate for active users 18 months out is 20 percent).  This pattern in conversion rates makes sense, since users are basically storing their memories in Evernote and the more they do that the more valuable it becomes to them.  ” You can use it for free,” says Libin, “but we want people to use it forever, so that your memories in Evernote become the most valuable thing you have, period.”
Libin says the company is profitable on a gross margin basis.  He is able to cover all of his variable costs from revenues, and is on track to become fully profitable over the next 18 months.  In November, Libin raised another $10 million, bringing the total raised to $26 million.  “We definitely sold the vision, but nobody would have bought without the metrics,” says Libin of how he raised the money.  Trying to become the de facto life recorder is a long ten-year vision.  Evernote’s steady traction in attracting premium subscribers is what will allow it to get there.
Evernote’s new users per day keeps growing every time it launches on a new platform or an upgrade (as it did over Christmas for its iPhone app, which now offers local storage).  Those 2 million cumulative users are spread across iPhones (49 percent), Windows desktops (30 percent), Web browsers (29 percent), Mac clients (17 percent), Palm Pres (4.4 percent), Windows Mobile (3.9 percent), Blackberries (3.8 percent), and Android (1.4 percent).  These device percentages add up to more than 100 because some people use Evernote on more than one device.
Looking at new users per day is more instructive.  For instance, the Android app which just launched two weeks ago is signing up about 2,000 new users per day, about the same as the iPhone app.  iPhone users represent 34 percent of daily active users, but Android already represents 3.4 percent—more than Windows Mobile, Blackberry or Palm Pre (which are all range from 1.2 percent to 1.8 percent).  Libin thinks Android will contribute significant growth in 2010.  At its current rate of signing up about 6,000 new users a day, Evernote should hit its next million-user milestone in 166 days.

At an event I went to recently I asked the panel what book summed up the best way to startup. One of the panelists sung the praises of a new book aimed at startups: “Getting to Plan B”. I tweeted this out and, as if by magic, I was contacted by the authors offering a guest post. John Mullins is an Associate Professor of Management Practice and holds the David and Elaine Potter Foundation Term Chair in Marketing and Entrepreneurship at London Business School.  Randy Komisar is a Partner at Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers in California.  Their new book, “Getting to Plan B: Breaking Through to a Better Business Model,” was recently published by Harvard Business Press. It strikes me that their iterative model is better suited to the way tech startups operate.
If the founders of Google or PayPal had stuck to their original business plans, we’d likely never have heard of them. Instead, they made radical changes to their initial models, became household names, and delivered huge returns for their investors. How did they get from their Plan A to a business model that worked?  Why did they succeed when most new technology ventures crash and burn?

Let’s face an uncomfortable fact: the typical startup process, largely driven by poorly conceived business plans based on untested assumptions, is seriously flawed. Most new ventures, even those with venture capital backing, share one common characteristic. They fail. But there is a better way to launch new ideas—without wasting years of your time and loads of investors’ money. This better way is about discovering a business model that really works: a Plan B which grows out of the original idea, builds on it, and once it’s in place, enables the business to grow rapidly and prosper.
Getting to Plan B in Your Business 
How can you break through to a business model that will work for your business? First, you’ll need an idea to pursue.  The best ideas resolve somebody’s pain, some customer problem you’ve identified for which you have a solution that might work.  Google, for example, makes hard-to-find information instantly accessible. Alternatively, some good ideas take something in customers’ lives that’s pretty boring – think old-fashioned coffee shops, many of them now gone, supplanted by Starbucks – and create something so superior it provides true customer delight.
Next, you’ll need to identify some analogs, portions of which you can be borrow or adapt to help you understand the economics and various other facets of your proposed business and its business model. You’ll need antilogs, too. Analogs and antilogs don’t have to only be from your own industry, though.  Sometimes the most valuable insights come from unusual sources, as was the case for Steve Jobs in turning Apple from an innovative but struggling PC-maker into a music industry phenomenon. Jobs copied ideas from Sony’s Walkman, Napster’s free but illegal downloads, and more.
Having identified both analogs and antilogs, you can quickly reach conclusions about some things that are known about your venture.  But it is not what you know that will likely scupper your Plan A – it’s what you don’t know.  The questions you cannot answer from historical precedent lead to your leaps of faith – beliefs you hold about the answers to your questions despite having no real evidence that these beliefs are actually true.
To address your leaps of faith, you’ll have to leap!  Identify your leaps of faith early and devise ways to test hypotheses that will prove or refute them. By doing so, you are in a position to learn whether or not your Plan A will work before you waste too much time and money.
But what do you actually need to consider when developing your business model?  Every model needs to quantitatively address five key elements:
• Revenue Model: Who will buy?  How often? How soon?  At what cost?  How much money will you receive each time a customer buys?  How often will they send you another check?
• Gross Margin Model:  How much of your revenue will be left after you have paid the direct costs of what you have sold?
• Operating Model:  Other than the cost of the goods or services you have sold, what else must you spend money on to keep the lights on?
• Working Capital Model:  How early can you encourage your customers to pay?  Do you have to tie up money in lots of inventory waiting for customers to buy?  Can you pay your suppliers later, after the customer has paid?
• Investment Model:  How much cash must you spend up front before enough customers give you enough business to cover your costs?
Uncovering the right analogs and antilogs, identifying your most important leaps of faith, and testing a series of hypotheses to inform all five elements of your business model doesn’t happen in a single ”eureka” moment. Getting to a viable Plan B is a journey that can take numerous iterations over months, perhaps years. For PayPal, what eventually worked was founder Max Levchin’s Plan G!
To guide this process, we suggest you build a dashboard – a systematic record that will focus your attention on the critical issues and more efficiently deploy your precious time and resources to removing the critical risks.  It provides a way to respond to the real-life data you generate and make mid-course corrections when your data so indicates.
The Cold, Hard Facts 
Most business plans assume that most everything is already known up front – not the case, as the PayPal example shows.  As the famed American general in World War II, Douglas MacArthur, is reputed to have said, “No plan ever survives its first encounter with the enemy.”
The process articulated here is a healthy alternative to the straight-jacket of today’s business planning practices, to enable you to anticipate and move beyond a failing Plan A. It is a process designed for learning and discovering, rather than for pitching and selling.  It’s a process that recognizes the cold, hard facts: most often, what ultimately works, is not the Plan A that was so persuasively articulated in the original plan.  Instead, it’s Plan B.
Plan A is usually an idea that emerges from something you observe: a behavior, problem or bigger trend.
If you decide to follow your idea and dig deeper into the industry, the necessary technology, the economics, analyze the behavior in more detail – simply ‘live’ with this idea and thoughts for a while – your picture of what is actually going on becomes clearer every day.
Some initial ideas, the A Plans, might get confirmed and develop into successful businesses. Others will have to be abandoned (with or without actually starting a business).
Either way, the result for our entrepreneur always is that she knows more (usually by several magnitudes) about the ‘market’. This might be the reason that we see so many successful B Plans: they might still be bold, but they are also a lot more realistic.
Does this mean that specialists, who know a market intimately are more likely to hit a home run the first time around? I don’t think so, for several reasons… but that’s probably a different discussion.

[France] On stage at last year’s Le Web an argument broke out between co-founder Loic Le Meur and TechCrunch’s Michael Arrington over whether Europe was capable of producing a ‘big win’ Web company or whether Skype was, perhaps, just a one-hit wonder. Like heavyweight fighters, both of them traded some heavy blows in subsequent blog posts. But during the live on-stage Gilmour Gang, one company was mentioned by Le Meur which left the rest of the assembled staring blankly: Vente-Privee.
Probably the reason it prompted such sideways looks however is that this is not a classic web app startup, but an ecommerce hub. Vente-Privee began in France in 2001, but has only recently become a powerhouse of a new wave in Europe: online private sales clubs involving designer fashion brands, otherwise known in the fashion retail industry as the “overstock market”. Its success has lead to a bunch of clone sites, while Vente-Privee itself is on target to €650m in turnover globally this year. In other words Europe is not out to lunch – as Arrington put it – it is out to shop.

Private buyers clubs are business models tailor-made for the recession, offering big discounts on designer goods among virtually guaranteed buyers. They also hit revenue almost from the word go.
That success has now lead to a number of US companies becoming very interested in either entering this world or expanding their operations. TechCrunch Europe thus understands, from some very good sources, that Gilt, Amazon and eBay are all actively looking at acquisitions in the European private shopping club space. The price for Vente-Privee alone is being talked about in terms of a $1.5 billion sale. Some sources even put the figure at between $2 billion and $4 billion.
One VC I spoke to said Vente Privee was “very attractive” to the big ecommerce beasts like Amazon and eBay, and a roll-up of these types of clubs is potentially in the offing across Europe. Another said “It would be a good move – depending on price – from either Amazon or eBay.”
It’s not that surprising. Aside from its existing operations, Vente Privee is even now pushing into high end fashion, and, I’m told, just did a sale for the Chloe brand that was not advertised anywhere else, which shows how far the site has come inside the famously closed fashion industry. The company now has over 1,000 employees and 18 photography studios at its French HQ, housed in the vast, former printing factory for the Le Monde newspaper. It has now started an assault on the fashion UK market, which is worth £50 billion annually.
Back in the UK, eBay has been dabbling in the private sales market. It recently introduced eBay OUTLET on its UK site.
This new addition to the eBay platform sells merchandise at up to 70% off retail prices from various brands that have their own shop-in-shop presence on the site. For eBay buying Vente-Privee could work extremely well. It has a large audience, but it’s known for auctions, not for private overstock sales.
Private shopping clubs have exploded over the European continent.
Last year Newspaper group News International invested in BrandAlley UK, a joint venture with French online boutique BrandAlley France, itself backed by France’s Banexi Ventures.
In Russia, online shopping club KupiVIP.ru, operated by Privat Trade, counts Mangrove Capital Partners as a backer.
In April this year BuyVIP, the Spain-based private online buying club, raised about $20 million in its third round of funding, led by Kennet Partners. Mangrove (along with Bertelsmann, 3i and Molins Capital) is in that as well.
And two year old brands4friends – with two million members in Germany – is on course to do sales of €85 million ($124.3 million) this year – more than three times as much as last year. Unsurprisingly founder Christian Heitmeyer is being courted by VCs, but so far has backing from Partech International, Holtzbrinck Ventures, and… Mangrove Capital Partners again.
In the US, Gilt Groupe, Ideeli, Rue La La and others are creating a similar wave of hype – and cash.
But Europe’s private buyers clubs had better hurry with their courting of the US leviathans. Retailers are planning their inventories better in this down market so overstock sales may begin to dry up. It would be a shame miss that window for a $1.5bn exit.
This is a joke, eh? Gilt doesn’t have the slightest chance of buying anyone for $2B. Nice try.

How come this kind of news is not also written about on Techcrunch France ?
Sounds like a strong market to break into.
hmmm a bad business move ? then my guess is eBay will do it !
twitter.com/ben_thomas_ech
“become a powerhouse of the new wave in Europe”
and by Europe you mean France?
Let this French company eat cake.
$2-$4billion?  This has to be some of the worst over-blown hype/trype I’ve read.
The company does about $1b in total sales with 1,000 employees?  It has to sell its items at 70% discounts?
Let’s do the math — an in-market Hermes Scarf for $300 has to sell after-market at $90 to sell on this market.  The company’s employee costs alone are 10% of the business.   What is the product cost considering the manufacturer has to make a mark-up?   Maybe product cost of $50?  So they are taking in $40 in gross margin.  Deduct $10 in employee cost and you have $30 left — 33% margin to cover EVERY cost.
Remember, this is not schlocky items we are talking about here.  The buyer of these items is going to expect and EXCELLENT shopping experience and immediate service levels.
Perhaps, even in the best case, the operating margin is 10%.  10% on $1b is $100million.  At best.  To reach a $2b-$4b valuation you are talking about 20-40 times earnings.
Where is the value-add?  It is in selling an other-wise $300 item for $90.  That takes a real genius to do.
C’mon.   Get real.  If this is the best Europe can offer — we’ll take the stinky cheese instead.  This one smells worse.
if at least you tried to gather some background info on the company you are trashing before posting you’d avoid looking so ridiculous.
In terms of operating profit margin you can at least double the result of your flawed analysis. And Hermes selling online at a discount? Seriously next time just don’t post..
go tweet that to your $1b twitter
The article mentions Gilt, Amazon and eBay are shopping around Europe for private shopping clubs, not looking at Vente Privée only: they are “actively looking at acquisitions in the European private shopping club space.”
Indeed, there are a good dozen websites to look at in Europe, built on this model… In France, Spain, Germany and the UK.
And your margin calculation is incorrect, margins are double that in the overstock business…
Double that in the overstock business?  Are you kidding me?
You do know that Overstock itself is in the overstock business?
Have you looked at their margins?
Clearly none of you guys actually SELLS this stuff online.
IntellectGetOne, I am actually a founder and shareholder of such a company, so I do know the model inside and out, and I DO sell “that stuff” online.
As for the sale price, it’s pretty obvious: what do you think is the BUY price so you can SELL at 70% off retail????
Amazon just bought Zappos for $850 million.  Why would they acquire this company?
If Vente-Privee is as big as you say it is, it would be better off going public.
not to mention that Gilt is a private company probably worth about $600M and they are going to buy a much larger company in France? Simply could never happen under any circumstances. Only thing that is possible would be a merger, but even that is a real stretch.
Gilt is worth $600M? That cracks me up. They are on a burn rate and at this point have yet to actually release any numbers other than estimating that they will do $500M in sales next year. For all anyone knows, they haven’t broken $100M in sales yet so they are most definitely not a $600M company.
Gilt is riding a wave of hype and success.  They hired 50 people last month (up to 250 now), closed a $43M round (valued at $400M) and is poised to earn $150M this year.  Will see what happens, they’re an interesting company to watch with some very high expectations to meet.  To put them in the same category as Amazon & Zappos is a bit premature.
Gilt’s riding a wave of hype for sure – it’s like 1999 all over again. Hire a celebrity CEO (look at her record at Martha Stewart OmniLiving), get funding at a ridiculous and unproven valuation because you have ties to the VC market (one of Gilts founders is the same guy that owns Silicon Alley Insider so he already runs in those circles), then hype yourself as having $500M in sales in 2010 when you haven’t proven you can even hit $100M in 2009.  Nice concept, but Rue la la and Vente Privee were at it long before Gilt was. Oh, one other thing – hyping that they might hit  $150M in revenue this year is not the same as having $150M in earnings……
For the bunch of readers commenting on Gilt buying Vente-Privee, read again. The opposite is being discussed.
As for IntellectGetOne’s brilliant comment, your nickname is a perfect match – it’s time to get one indeed – you clearly have no clue about VP’s business, nor fashion (Hermes sold at a discount on an e-commerce site ? How about Ferrari or Porsche while you’re at it ?).

							BTW I love your blog!
Pete,
We’ll forgive the double-post as a mark of your knowledge.
You can deny the numbers all you want — but I have been in this business for years.  There are no margins for the seller.  Sure, it is a business which will make you a living.  But there is no way, on any continent, that this business is throwing off anything more than 10% ebidta margins — NO chance.   And anyone dumb enough to pay 20-40 times ebidta is an absolute fool or a Nobel Peach Prize judge.
Please — if your wisdom is so grand — enlighten us.  How does a company sell fashion brand items a season late at 70% of retail and make a stunningly high profit?
The world awaits the genius who can show us that model (and includes the 1,000 employees to boot).
Last week Brands4friends announced its break even after 2 years in business.
I guess not every company needs to get tons of media coverage to make good revenues. I always admire companies that just plug away in the back ground making money without needing the oxygen of publicity.

The €650 MM turnover means “revenues” of Vente-Priveé or GMS (gross merchandise sales)?. If it is the latter (most likely) then the gross revenues of VP should be somewhere around €40/60 MM. A 2+Billion valuation for a company generating a few tens of millions makes no sense to me.
€650 MM turnover is Sales/Revenues (“Chiffre d’Affaires” in France), not GMS.
Thank you Michael. Really impressive then!. That type of valuation makes a lot of sense in principle then!. Regards

If you’re a European startup then you need to check out Plugg organised by long-time Web 2.0 consultant, blogger, entrepreneur and now TechCrunch contributor Robin Wauters. The event will take place on the 12th of March in Brussels, Belgium, and will feature a host of top speakers from the continent, and a startup competition. Registration for the Plugg Start-ups Rally, which is free to enter, is now open, and the deadline for registration has been set to Wednesday 4 February at midnight (CET). Any European early-stage company with a maximum of only one round of institutional funding can sign up for the competition by entering details about their team, concept and business model until Wednesday the 4th of February at midnight on this dedicated mini-site. All submissions that fit the criteria will be carefully evaluated by a professional jury of pundits and VCs, and twenty will ultimately be invited to pitch at the audience from the main stage at the conference.
Interesting that there hasn’t been more comments here, reading through the criteria it was interesting to see the – ‘market potential – gross margins’
Just thinking of the start-ups with traction that have no gross margin or any commercial plans as yet – Twitter, etc…
I’m not saying you shouldn’t plan for profit but so many entrepreneurs I talk to seem to concentrate so much on trying to copy the ‘success’ of the non-revenue generating start-ups they see that they do forget about margins and concentrate on traction.
Fair comment Gary. As one VC said to me the other day – the best funding is customer revenue. Talk about an about turn from a while back…
Have you guys seen this?
http://thenextweb.com/2009/01/26/caught-act-techcrunch-copy-paste-crimes/
It’s half way between really funny and pathetic though.
However, the submission form is pretty generic, so my opinion is that gross margins, 3 year insight and that other stuff is more something they hope to see rather than something they demand.
In any case, it’s worth a go because I’ve heard loads of good feedbacks about last year’s Plugg.
Fabio, we’re messing around, we’re all stealing from each other :)
Read the comments too.

Apple’s SEC filing just hit the wires and it’s a doozy: $10 billion in sales and things as rosy as a the cheeks of an Irish lass on a brisk morning. Apple’s gross margin is up 34.7 percent from last year and we’re supposedly in some sort of recession. Nearly 23 million iPods were sold this quarter and over 2.5 million Macs were sold. The iPhone continues to sell well for Apple with over 4 million units sold.
Can someone please tell me why investors are freaking out just because Jobs is sick? I’ve said this from the beginning and I’ll say it again, Apple will continue to sell iPods and MacBooks with or without Jobs. Consumers don’t care who heads the company. So long as the products continue to be ‘pretty’ and evolve as they have in the last decade they’ll sell. Who’s going to design all the fancy new hardware? The same guys and gals who’ve been doing so for the last decade or however long it’s been.
Apple Reports First Quarter Results
Best Quarterly Revenue and Earnings in Apple History
iPod Sales Set New Record
CUPERTINO, California—January 21, 2009—Apple® today announced financial results for its fiscal 2009 first quarter ended December 27, 2008. The Company posted record revenue of $10.17 billion and record net quarterly profit of $1.61 billion, or $1.78 per diluted share. These results compare to revenue of $9.6 billion and net quarterly profit of $1.58 billion, or $1.76 per diluted share, in the year-ago quarter. Gross margin was 34.7 percent, equal to the year-ago quarter. International sales accounted for 46 percent of the quarter’s revenue.
In accordance with the subscription accounting treatment required by GAAP, the Company recognizes revenue and cost of goods sold for iPhone™ and Apple TV® over their economic lives. Adjusting GAAP sales and product costs to eliminate the impact of subscription accounting, the corresponding non-GAAP measures* for the quarter are $11.8 billion of “Adjusted Sales” and $2.3 billion of “Adjusted Net Income.”
Apple sold 2,524,000 Macintosh® computers during the quarter, representing nine percent unit growth over the year-ago quarter. The Company sold a record 22,727,000 iPods during the quarter, representing three percent unit growth over the year-ago quarter. Quarterly iPhone units sold were 4,363,000, representing 88 percent unit growth over the year-ago quarter.
“Even in these economically challenging times, we are incredibly pleased to report our best quarterly revenue and earnings in Apple history—surpassing $10 billion in quarterly revenue for the first time ever,” said Steve Jobs, Apple’s CEO.

Many people still think of IBM as the company that sells Big Iron—mainframes and its enterprise server descendants.  Of course, the engine of the company’s profits long ago shifted to consulting and software.  In a financial slide presentation IBM released today to the SEC as an 8K document, however, you really get a sense of how much IBM has continued to shift its business towards software and services over the past eight years.
The result has been a very healthy expansion in its profit margins.  As can be seen in the chart above, IBM’s pre-tax income margins have more than doubled from a low of 7.2 percent in 2002 to 16.1 percent in 2008.  And the slide presentation suggests that IBM has further to go.  It cites data showing that the top quartile of companies in the S&P 500, and 30 percent of tech companies, have pre-tax income margins of above 20 percent.  IBM makes $90 billion in revenues per year, so each percentage gain in pre-tax profit margins adds up to nearly $1 billion.

The reason for IBM’s margin expansion is that the pre-tax profits in its  software and services businesses are growing at double-digit rates.  Both segments will make an estimated $8 billion in pre-tax profits this year, compared to about $1.5 billion for hardware.  Eight years ago, the software business brought in only $2.8 billion in pre-tax profits and the services business produced $4.5 billion.
IBM has made big investments in middleware, database software, virtualization, cloud computing, and business analytics, to name a few areas. It sounds like these are paying off big-time.
Contrast IBM’s financial condition today to that of the late 1990s.  Back then, gross margins were declining every year, even as it was cutting expenses to compensate.  Today, expenses as a percentage of revenues are actually going up as it continues to plow more money back into the business in the form of investments and R&D.  Over the past five years, IBM spent $30 billion on R&D, second only to Microsoft’s $36 billion (Google spent only $7 billion, which also is less than Cisco, HP, and Oracle).

This isn’t exactly new  news, since its earnings were reported last Wednesday, but it’s a fact worth highlighting these days: Drugstore.com is now effectively a profitable business as it has been able to turn an operating profit for the fourth quarter of 2008, the first time since it went public in 1999.
The company would have gotten there sooner, if it weren’t for the fact that the state of New Jersey settled against the company in a sales tax case, costing the company $2.5 million and resulting in a quarterly loss for Q4 2007, when the company had originally thought it would be turning an operating profit.
The company this week reported quarterly net sales of just south of $94 million and net income of $289,000, and jumped to profitability thanks to an increase in customers (+400,000 new customers in Q4 alone) and solid sales of over-the-counter products. The company achieved fourth quarter gross margins of 28.5% and the highest adjusted EBITDA in the history of the company of $5.2 million, which is up 243% over Q4 2007.
For the year, Drugstore.com reported net sales of $366.6 million, a net loss of $8.3 million and an operating cash flow of $9.9 million for 2008.

When TubeMogul first filed to go public, it indicated that it would offer up to $75 million of its shares for sale. That figure was soft. Today, TubeMogul decided on a price range for its shares — $11 to $13 per unit — meaning that it could sell up to $93.4 million of its stock in the flotation.
The company’s revenue has grown quickly, as had its losses until recently. It recorded a $7.4 million loss in 2013, the highest of its three reported year-long periods. However, in the first quarter of 2014, the company’s revenue — $22.02 million, up from $9.58 million in the year-ago quarter — came attached to a slim $767,000 loss, down from $1.90 million the year before.
So, quick revenue growth and falling losses? In today’s market that could very well be a palatable combination.
We’ve seen a decent string of recent IPOs, with Arista Networks, MobileIron, and GoPro all performing well when entering the public markets. With profitability just out of its reach, TubeMogul may benefit from the lift those successful offerings might provide.
As TechCrunch previously noted, the company had strong gross margins — we called them “SaaS-like” — of 66 percent in 2013. The company has raised $53.2 million to date, making its offering interesting. It isn’t uncommon now to see companies going public, raising a fraction of their previously raised capital in the process.
TubeMogul is a smaller IPO for a lesser-known company. This isn’t Box, in other words, but its nearly $100 million potential haul is important to note not only for its market niche, but also in that it will be a fresh indicator of investor sentiment. With the NASDAQ at 4,451, anything is possible.
As a caveat to that: When the company filed to go public, AdAge noted that a few companies that it found to be at least analogous had suffered since their debut, highlighting YuMe and Tremor Video. Those companies have seen steep declines in their market value in the past year. It’s worth pointing out that many companies in TubeMogul’s space have either gone public, or been acquired. After TubeMogul hits go, the only private, unacquired firm in the space will be BrightRoll.
All told, it looks like TubeMogul is full speed ahead. We’ll bring you more once they cross the wire and start to trade.

Intel’s second quarter results came in above expectations, with the chip company reporting revenue of $13.8 billion, and earnings per share of $0.55. The street had expected Intel to earn $.52 on revenue of $13.69 billion.
Intel had previously raised its revenue expectations to $13.7 billion, with a margin of error of up to $300 million. It met that mark.
What drove the quarter for the technology giant? Metal. Its PC division saw its revenue rise 6 percent year-over-year to $8.7 billion, and its Data Center Group grew 19 percent, with top line of $3.5 billion. The company’s smaller Internet of Things group grew 24 percent year-over-year to $539 million in revenue. Its Mobile division saw its revenue decline sharply, however, falling 83 percent on a yearly basis, to a slim $51 million.
Intel had a billion dollars more in revenue in the second quarter of 2014 than it did in the second quarter of 2013. Its gross margin improved as well, to 64.5 percent, up from 58.3 percent.
For the full year, Intel expects revenue growth of 5 percent, which it states is “slightly higher” than its “prior expectations.” With net income of $2.79 billion, and cash and short-terms of nearly $8 billion, Intel appears to be in decent shape.
The company is currently working to expand its mobile chip business, in hopes of growing its share in powering tablets and smartphones, markets where its competitors have so far ruled. Its mobile results this quarter, however, including a sequential-quarter decline of 67 percent, were not strong. The company did affirm in its release that it is still on track to sell 40 million tablet processors this year.
Investors, however, appear content with the results, and have bid shares of Intel up more than 4 percent in after-hours trading.

After much ado and pomp, Box released its updated S-1 document yesterday, revamping some of its usage statistics, and detailing the results of its fiscal first quarter. The company posted revenue of $45.3 million in the period, up 93.6 percent year-over-year. Its net loss totaled $38.5 million in the quarter, up a slimmer 13 percent.
Box burned through $29.58 million in cash during the period, ending its fiscal first quarter with $79.26 million (calculated using the delta of its quarter-on-quarter cash and equivalents line item). The company recently raised another $150 million. Presuming that the company has burned through another $10 to $15 million since the end of its first quarter, Box has a comfortable stack of more than $200 million on hand.
The company spent more on sales and marketing, $47.44 million, than it had in total top line in the period.
In its updated S-1, Box indicated that its number of registered users rose by 2 million in the quarter to 27 million. It also reported 5,000 new “paying organizations,” ending the quarter with 39,000.
So where does that put Box? If it isn’t clear, don’t worry. We’ll do this in steps.
Box’s calendar 2013 was an on-purpose financial bloodbath. Losses outstripped its revenue by more than 100%, and the company tore through cash with something approaching glee. It more than doubled its revenues — we’re saying calendar 2013, which is roughly commensurate with Box’s fiscal 2014, but let’s not be too taxing in the morning — but it notched another year of nine-figure loss, calculated using generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).
Why was Box content to ignite huge sums of cash? It was betting on its own unit economics, buying recurring revenue by sustaining huge sales and marketing costs.
Whether Box’s bet will bear out isn’t too hard to vet. If its revenue growth remains quick, and its losses stall, and begin to retreat, the company has a way out of the woods. It won’t be profitable any time soon, but the most recent period may indicate the start a new trend of loss deceleration far quicker than inevitably slowing revenue growth.
Fans of SaaS-based accounting will tell you that if you have solid margins — 80 percent is a commonly cited gross margin target — and a customer acquisition cost (CAC) to lifetime value of that customer (LTV) ratio of less than a third, spending oodles on getting more customers isn’t risky. In fact, in their view, to not burn quickly is to be too conservative. (Your unit economics are great, why aren’t you stomping on the gas pedal?)
That’s fine, but to grow in that fashion you are going to consume mountains of cash, because, as SaaS kids will tell you again and again, you incur full marketing a sales costs to land a deal, and then enjoy the ensuing revenue in small pieces. So you deal with losses up front, and profits down the road.
So why isn’t Box profitable, given that it has spent heavily and thus, presumably, built a mountain of annual recurring revenue (ARR), that pixie dust of long-term cash flows? Well, Box is still spending on growth, so it continues to lose money.
Forever? No. In fact, over time we should see the company’s losses decline as its marketing spend as a percentage of its revenue declines — all that piled up ARR, born out of past losses may allow Box to keep its marketing spend steady, or on a gentle incline, while its net loss shrinks.
You don’t get to negative net loss declines until you reach a point in which your net loss stalls, and you don’t get there without seeing your net loss growth rate decline. Box may be a that initial point.
So, looking ahead, Box will lose more than $100 million this year. That’s certain. But it should lose less than last year’s epic $168.9 million deficit, and its revenue should be north of $200 million.
Box with top line of more than $200 million and losses close to the $100 million mark makes far more sense than Box’s 2013 — again, fiscal 2014, roughly — $124 million in revenue, and $168.9 million in losses.
At issue is when the lines cross. How long can Box afford to burn to grow, and when does its past burn help its growth by easing losses? Do you value Box on its top-line growth, or on its potential future profits? You can’t do it on both.
The campari in this particular negroni is churn, which for Box is at least partially driven by hell-bent sector competition. The core presumption of SaaS accounting is that churn won’t eat away at your CAC/LTV ratio. If churn increases, your ratio gets borked, harming your unit economics, and perhaps making your burn not an investment in future revenue, but instead a great effort to sell quarters for dimes.
Box has enough cash to last for perhaps two years without an IPO. And it will IPO this year, all signs indicate. So Box will have, presuming that it raises the $250 million it indicated in its initial S-1 that it wants to, even more space to grow.
It’s time for a wager: In which forthcoming quarter will Box post a net loss decline, on a year-over-year basis?
What’s the bear case? That Box won’t be able to sustain its growth rates in an economically feasible fashion. That’s to say that it could become more expensive than Box can afford to acquire new customers, making its growth cycle unprofitable on a SaaS basis.* If your view is that sector competition will reduce Box’s enterprise niche, you could foresee Box’s future cash flows impaired. It’s fair to say that if that is the case, Box would be quite troubled.
That’s enough for now. We’ll check in around 90 days when Box has new numbers. Lay your wagers in the comments.
*SaaS: Not The New GAAP.

Apple has just released its fiscal Q3 2014 earnings, reporting $37.4 billion in revenue, $7.7 billion in net profit representing $1.28 per share. Compared to the year-ago quarter, it corresponds to a growth of 5.9 percent in revenue, and 19.6 percent in EPS (adjusted for the 7-for-1 split).
Fortune‘s consensus among analysts was for Apple to report earnings of $1.26 per share on $38.31 billion in revenue, with both revenue and EPS growing. In particular, analysts estimated that the gross margin should be around 38.0 percent, boosting the company’s Earnings.
What happened in reality is that the gross margin was even higher than that at 39.4 percent. But the company slightly disappointed when it comes to revenue. That’s why it managed to stay ahead of analysts’ expectations for earnings per share with a revenue below what everyone anticipated. In particular, iPad sales were disappointing.
Apple’s own guidance from its last earnings release predicted between $36 billion and $38 billion in revenue, with gross margin between 37 percent and 38 percent. In 2013, Apple’s guidance has been much more accurate than before, with the upper end of the forecast very close to what it actually reported. Last quarter was an exception as Apple was above its numbers. Now everything is back on track.
In other words, analysts and Apple itself all anticipated a good quarter, especially due to a better gross margin. It was indeed the case, but revenue was supposed to be even better than that. While the iPhone 5c was designed to solve the company’s gross margin issue, it didn’t sell as well as anticipated. There are probably other improvements. Maybe people chose the iPad Air over the iPad mini compared to last year.
“Our record June quarter revenue was fueled by strong sales of iPhone and Mac and the continued growth of revenue from the Apple ecosystem, driving our highest EPS growth rate in seven quarters,” Apple CEO Tim Cook wrote in the release. “We are incredibly excited about the upcoming releases of iOS 8 and OS X Yosemite, as well as other new products and services that we can’t wait to introduce.”
This quarter, Apple sold 35.3 million iPhones, 13.3 million iPads and 4.4 million Macs in the quarter. Compared to Q3 2013, iPhone sales grew by 13.9 percent while iPad sales declined by 8.9 percent. Read all the details about hardware sales in our separate post.
China represented once again a big growth driver for the company. A significant portion of iPhone and iPad sales came from China. Read more in our post.
Apple has performed incredible well on the stock market. After splitting its shares 7 for 1 stock split and boosting its dividend strategy, shares have been steadily going up for the last three months, nearing its all-time high of $100.81 after adjustment. Shortly after the release, shares are stable in after-hours trading (down 0.44 percent).
Apple’s own guidance for Q4 2014 predicts between $37 billion and $40 billion in revenue with a gross margin between 37 and 38 percent. The company reported $37.5 billion in revenue last year.

Later today, Apple will announce its quarterly earnings for Q3 2014. For the past couple of years, the April-to-June quarter has been the slowest quarter of the year for the company. Before that, Apple used to refresh its iPad lineup in the spring. Now, it seems like nothing is happening during the Q3 quarter. But gross margin is on the rise and should make this quarter more impressive than expected.
This year is no exception from the slow quarter news. Besides WWDC’s iOS 8 and OS X Yosemite announcements, Apple didn’t share much. The company has repeated multiple times that there should be interesting product updates in the fall. Does it mean that Apple’s quarterly results are going to suffer?
When it comes to both revenue and profit, Apple is growing. Analysts and Apple’s own estimates say that revenue should be on the rise from $35.3 billion in Q3 2013 to anywhere between $36 billion and $38.3 billion, or even more than that.
Yet, this is nothing compared to the bigger news: Apple is printing money again. Last year, Apple reported a 36.9 percent gross margin — it was a three-year low. This year, gross margin should be around 38 percent. It doesn’t seem much, but when you are talking about more than $35 billion in revenue, it greatly impacts the bottom line. According to Fortune, Earnings should be up around 18 percent, which is very impressive.
So how did Apple improve its gross margin? Apple usually doesn’t say much during its earnings calls, but we can make some educated guesses. First, Apple released the iPhone 5c, which was supposed to solve the company’s gross margin issue. While the company admitted that iPhone 5c sales were lower than expected, the company probably sold a few millions of those. And it was able to generate more cash from these devices compared to previous generation iPhones that use more expensive components compared to plastic.
There were probably other improvements in the production line of other Apple devices as well. Retina displays for MacBooks may have gotten cheaper, and the iPad Air may have been a bigger success than the iPad 4.
As always, it’s hard to know for sure before the earnings release. We’ll cover today’s earnings from multiple angles and share the most interesting tidbits from the earnings call later today, starting around 1:30pm PDT, 4:30pm EDT, 9:30pm BST.

Editor’s note: Ajay Chopra is a general partner at Trinity Ventures, with investments in several digital media and m-commerce companies including TubeMogul (IPO), Fitstar, Zirx, Dynamic Signal, Blend and Deliv. He is on the board of RadiumOne. Prior to joining Trinity Ventures, he co-founded Pinnacle Systems.
There are major changes afoot in advertising technology at the moment, but not everyone has realized how transformational these changes are. Indeed, analysts have talked about four types of business models in the ad-tech ecosystem, but have not discussed the underlying innovation that is driving the more leveraged of these models.
So what should investors be looking for in ad-tech companies as they navigate the ad-tech landscape?
Brand Focus 
Ad-tech companies that are focusing on brand dollars have a massive opportunity to access non-digital marketing spend, which is primarily TV advertising today. Google dominates performance-based advertising, which is essentially ads designed to create an action (such as click through to a site in case of search, or click through to a landing page in case of display advertising).
Brand advertising, on the other hand, is about delivering a catchy or compelling message that is memorable and creates a positive impression of a brand in a viewer’s mind (think Super Bowl ads). This is a trickier proposition to deliver online and on mobile, but it is also a highly lucrative part of the advertising ecosystem and a huge growth opportunity.
In addition, TV ad buying is still manual and arcane and would benefit from the transparency and accountability of online ad-buying methodologies. Ad-tech companies that are focused on moving TV ad dollars and TV ad buying to the digital world are just in the early innings of their growth cycle.
Ad-tech companies that bring transparency to the ad buying eco system will have an advantage.
Ad exchanges have improved liquidity in the ad buying process. However marketers are leery of buying on exchanges if they have to do a blind buy via intermediaries such as ad networks. Solutions that provide complete visibility as to the sites that are being purchased and also “viewability” guarantees so that the ad is actually viewable (and not buried “below the fold” of the viewable page) will be seen as trusted partners for marketers and brands. Companies such as Integral Ad Sciences have built technology to help advertisers get visibility and build trust in the ecosystem.
Ad tech companies that show sales costs growing at a substantially slower rate than gross margin growth are good bets. This implies that each additional gross margin dollar is being generated by fewer incremental sales dollars. Tasty metrics like these can come from many sources including recurring revenue from existing clients, a more efficient selling process, or acquiring more profitable clients. In particular, companies that have “self serve” oriented software products exhibit higher gross margins and lower sales costs.
Google and AppNexus have exchanges on which these software platforms can execute real time bidding for ad placements, while Facebook and Twitter are opening up with APIs to allow these software platforms to buy ad placements on their properties. We think Pinterest will follow suit soon. An important part of this sales leverage is driven by platform sales to large brands. A partnership with large brands not only locks the advertiser’s spend but also has the benefit of a predictable revenue stream.
Ad tech companies are using big data techniques to target their advertising more precisely so ads are more effective for advertisers and less annoying for viewers at the same time. The most valuable data in this process is the so-called “first-party data”. This is the data that the brand has generated as it engages with its customers via various channels including its web sites, mobile apps, email, social media and campaigns. It differs from “third-party data” that is a collection of anonymized data from independent data providers and generally has lower efficacy and no inherent advantage vs competition in bidding for an ad impression.
If an ad tech company is working closely with brands to leverage the brands’ first party data, then the company has an inherent advantage that may not be available to many of its competitors.
A close working relationship with a brand on “first-party data” also implies that the brand intends to work with the ad tech company on a consistent basis rather than a one-off engagement. Criteo has done a great job leveraging first party data for re-targeting purposes. RadiumOne has gone a step further by allowing brands to “cultivate” first-party data using its mobile SDKs and web widgets for more precise segmentation and targeting.
A majority of mobile advertising today is performance focused (a large part of Facebook’s mobile ad revenue is reportedly from app downloads). Even though mobile is a small part of ad spend for most brands today, it is growing at a quick clip. Ad tech Companies that have built their technology stack to take advantage of the move of brand dollars to mobile will have a second wind in their sails.
Some years ago, ad tech companies were building their own infrastructures. In a world where a business the size of Netflix can run on public cloud infrastructure such as Amazon Web Services, innovative ad tech companies are leveraging the economies and scalability of these platforms in their own vertical and the advantage here is immense.
As a business scales quickly and sometimes unpredictably, having an elastic backend that is stress-tested, redundant and globally available is invaluable.
Overall, the ad-tech sector has been difficult for public investors to understand. Several companies that have listed have underperformed. But advertising is the prime driver of the online and mobile ecosystem, and it is going through a massive reinvention with the advent of new technologies, better business models and more transparency.
Smart entrepreneurs are reinventing the old way of doing business and investors would be well advised (and rewarded) to take the time to understand the differentiation between old guard and new age companies.

Hang with startup kids long enough, and you’ll notice that they have their own language. No, bro, it’s a SaaS play in the on-demand food space. Think of it as the Uber for gluten-free Whole Foods delivery, ok? It never ends: We’re actively raising, but really want to make sure that we hit investor-board fit before product-market sync, you know?
This can be confusing.
However, TechCrunch is here to demystify startup lingo into a more common lingua franca. The startup kids, after all, are worth trying to understand. One or two of them might even build something usable.
So, without further ado, I give you How To Speak Startup:
Acqui-hire – A strategy for acquiring talent pioneered by Google in the mid-2000s that happens when a bigger company thinks your team is good but your idea is hilariously bad. Also called a “signing bonus.”
Failure – A bad thing that the Silly Valley has recently put on a pedestal as something to be celebrated.
Cashflow Positive – Someone gave us a dollar.
Pivot – What happens when a company realizes its course of action is not living up to expectations. The classic historic example is The Point, which became Groupon after the company posted a coupon to a pizza place in The Point’s building in Chicago. (See also, Failure.)
SaaS — It loses money.
Pre-Money Valuation – A number you made up.
Post-Money Valuation – A number that you made up alongside your VC with the addition of some cash. Your burn rate is probably too high.
“I work in PR.” – I am, in fact, in possession of several journalists’ email addresses.
Exit – Exits come in two different flavors for entrepreneurs: good and bad. Good exits happen when you’re “killing it,” your company hasn’t killed you yet, and another company comes along to buy yours. (See possibly, acqui-hire.) Bad exits are another way of saying you failed to disrupt much of anything besides your VC’s portfolio performance.
“I’m a serial entrepreneur.” – Person who had two ideas, both of which failed.
The Space – Because calling the field in which they’re operating an industry, vertical or even genre is too hard, entrepreneurs like referring to their company as being a player in a given space. They especially like doing this when they know they’re in a crowded market. We don’t know why they do this either.
VC – 1) Venture capitalists raise money from wealthy individuals and institutions and dump lots of said money into young companies in exchange for a cut of the company.  2) An institutional dealer of pharmaceutical-grade Opium. (See also, Opium.)
Opium – OPM, or “other people’s money,” is an incredibly addictive substance to entrepreneurs that’s rarely respected or missed until it dries up.
“We’re doing great.” – We are not doing great.
SF / The Valley – A place that VC’s and tech luminaries talk up as the greatest place on Earth that you must move to if you’re from anywhere that isn’t SF or The Valley.
“We’re growing 500 percent week-over-week” — Last week we had one user, today we have six.
“We’re not currently raising.” — We’re currently raising.
UI/UX – A portmanteau of UI (“User Interface”) and UX (“User Experience”) often used by design-challenged entrepreneurs when referring to the aesthetics and usability of their product when actual understanding of good design principles is fundamentally lacking. Used in a sentence: “Our Push for Pizza for Nickelodeon VHS tapes app is crushing it because of our design wizard is slinging some hella dope UI/UX.”
“We’re a design-centric organization.” – We don’t know how to code.
Non-GAAP Profitable — What companies that are very unprofitable like to claim. The idea that non-cash costs don’t count is usually the sort of sickness you see here.
“I’m the business guy.” – (See: Free-rider problem, Growth Hacker.)
Gravity — We don’t have that in Silicon Valley.
$32 Million Series A Round — Something that is doomed to failure.
Growth Hacking – Sales, marketing and associated activities, but with a label that incorporates the word “hacking,” because nontechnical people want to call themselves “hackers” too.
“We’re seeing great gross margins, and so are investing in growth given our strong, SaaS unit-economics.” — We lose money.
“We’re stomping on the gas pedal, given our strong SaaS unit-economics, and are actively seeking additional capital to power our sector-leading growth.” — We have lost all our money and need some of yours, please.
“We’re Crushing It!” – Your dreams and investors’ dollars are probably being crushed. First rule of Fight Club, bro.
We hope this helps.

Depending on whom you ask, companies that sell their products on a subscription basis are either companies that are veritable giants of growth, or firms that hide their business models’ inherent weakness in the form of short-term losses that are dismissed under the guise of investment.
Regardless of where you stand on this issue, companies based on the subscription model aren’t going away, if for no other reason than customers can’t wait three years between upgrades anymore. They need to move much more quickly than that and the subscription model accommodates that need for agility. Customers also don’t want to deal with the complexities of installing, managing and maintaining software anymore and the subscription model removes all of that.
In this post, we hash out the pros and cons of the subscription approach and argue whether its viability is just a matter of accounting semantics or a fundamental problem with the way these companies operate and the high cost of doing business in this fashion.
Ron Miller
Wall Street has tended to look at companies with subscriptions models showing red ink on the balance sheet with a fair bit of disdain this year. But perhaps traditional accounting methods aren’t the best measure of a subscription company. As Tien Tzuo, founder and CEO of Zuora told me, our accounting systems aren’t set up to accommodate a subscription model. “Our accounting systems, don’t know whether a dollar is going to recur,” he explained.
So if you’re Dollar Shave Club and you have 10 customers paying $5 a month for a year, you don’t have the revenue on the books yet for the life of the customer, even though you know you’re going to be earning that money (10 x 5 x 12) over the length of the subscription. The traditional accounting system can’t take this into, ahem, account.
When you start looking at enterprise companies, the numbers are much bigger, but the same problems apply.
Alex Wilhelm
The idea that we haven’t known in the past when a dollar of revenue will recur is only partially true. If a company signs a large support contract that will be serviced on a recurring basis, and tells its investors, they model under that presumption. Certainly, there can be minor GAAP-to-non-GAAP dissonance at play, but even the most rudimentary acolyte of corporate finance can parse the difference.
The strong version of this, of course, is when your entire revenue stack recurs. This is when you may begin to discount short-term losses more heavily in favor of longer-term recurring revenue. But the concept is merely the amplification of a problem that we had previously.
Companies have long had recurring and non-recurring revenue streams. AOL has lots of the former in the form of dial-up customers. (AOL owns TechCrunch.) It isn’t that hard to model. And yes, SaaS revenue has a few other quirks to it, but it’s still recurring revenue on a contract, making its DNA quite similar.
I’ll allow the following: When you are a high-growth organization, the effects of recurring revenue can become overshadowed, in the short-term, in the following circumstances: When you have long-term clients that are hard to land, have high, positive dollar-churn over the life of the account, and very high gross margins. This is when you have the highest up-front costs, compared to lifetime-value of a customer, which most distorts growing recurring revenue that must be accounted for in its own fashion.
Ron Miller
The biggest issue with the subscription model is that you have to spend a certain amount of money to acquire each customer and this cost rises substantially in the enterprise. At some point, usually I would suspect after a year or two depending on the customer size, you start making money and then it’s just pure income.
The problem for SaaS companies running on a subscription model is that there is a big upfront cost for acquiring customers that comes in the form of building a big-boy sales and marketing team. At some level, it’s not all that different from a traditional sales model and to get the best people you have to pay to lure them to the new kid on the block.
When you look at these costs on paper using traditional accounting methods, it doesn’t look very good for the company that is filing the S-1. There’s lots of red ink and losses, but there’s also money that’s coming, gobs and gobs of money if you ran your subscription company right. Perhaps if Wall Street began asking a different set of questions, it might begin looking at these companies more favorably. The money’s there, it’s just not accounted for because it won’t show up in the standard accounting methods for some time.
Maybe we need some new language and a new way of looking at this and if we were able to offer a line item for known recurring revenue in the pipeline, or if Wall Street financiers simply asked these questions during the company road show, it might flip how Wall Street sees these companies and what constitutes success.
Alex Wilhelm
What I want to know is why SaaS revenue can be so expensive. In the above, my colleague Ron Miller makes what I will call the common argument about SaaS revenue: Losses up front, party in the back.
Some large SaaS companies have spent more than three times their top line over the course of their life to build nine-figure annual recurring revenue. You can imply the cost of that. Not all companies have to burn so heavily to generate that amount of top-line, recurring or otherwise.
The corollary to that point is that the idea that SaaS incomes are future profit cannons is slightly doubtful — if that past revenue is now such pure profit, why doesn’t it support, and constrain future customer acquisition expenses, which contribute to gaping GAAP losses down the road, say, eight years, keeping revenue roughly equal to just the sales and marketing line item?
Even when the lines start to move toward crossing, the idea that SaaS revenue becomes a quick profit goldmine appears to be belied by the results of companies that we have the figures on; why is Salesforce still unprofitable, using normal accounting tools? Does its growth rate make its continued, and expected-to-continue, losses reasonable?
Ron Miller
There are so many companies out there working with this revenue model,  and the subscription model has so much potential because it isn’t a matter of getting you to buy something again and again. You have a service and so long as you are reasonably responsive to your customer’s needs, chances are you’re going to keep them.
Contrast this with the old model of selling boxed software (as one subscription model example) where the vendor spent a couple of years updating the software and the customer had to spend tons of money to upgrade. With the subscription model, the product is constantly being updated so customers are getting the benefits right away without waiting.
Since this model is more attractive to customers, it bodes well for the subscription companies who can count on continued revenue from happy users. You don’t have to sell them a new car. You sell them the service and your sales cycle is almost over. Of course, you want to add more licenses and schmooze for renewals, but the hard part is done once you’re in the door.
That should drive down the sales and marketing costs and over time, the cost to attain customers should level out. It may take a small leap of faith, but we are seeing it play out already as Zendesk bucked the trend and went public earlier this year and it’s doing just fine. Perhaps Wall Street needs just a few more examples like this before it finally comes around that subscription revenue is far more lucrative than selling one widget at a time.
Alex Wilhelm
This fits neatly under the idea that a SaaS account, once sold, becomes a quick profit source. The presumption I take is that once it has paid off its customer acquisition cost, which should take no more than one-third the life of the customer, gross margins give you wings and up go your margins. Again, I think that if this were the case, we would see different financial performance from firms that we have the figures on.
Let’s use an older firm to make our point: Microsoft now wants to sell Office on a subscription basis. The dollar amount is probably — measuring on an amortized basis for the Office In Box version — larger than what it previously took in. But the company now has greater server, bandwidth, and other costs. So does the margin situation really change?
And then there is the idea of continuous development; is it cheaper to build a product once in three years, ship it, and then restart? Or is it cheaper to ship every week? It probably varies for every company, but when every subscriber is now a continued research and development cost, taking part in other line-items as well, the idea of gross margin can, perhaps, become gross.
—
To summarize, SaaS companies can be great revenue engines, but we should be careful to dismiss all losses as reasonable investment. That, and there is nuance to long-term support and sales costs to selling software in this fashion that, for companies coming into the space from the Old World, might prove more costly than promised.
We look forward to SaaS kids shouting “3X LTV to CAC!” In the comments, as if we have never heard of the concept before.

Apple has just released its fiscal Q2 2014 earnings, reporting $45.6 billion in revenue, $10.2 billion in net profit representing $11.62 per share. Compared to the year-ago quarter, it corresponds to a growth of 4.6 percent in revenue, and 15.2 percent in EPS.
According to Fortune, the consensus among analysts was for Apple to report earnings of $10.22 per share on $43.45 billion in revenue, with revenue very slightly declining and EPS very slightly growing year-over-year.
Guidance from its last earnings release forecasted between $42 billion and $44 billion in revenue, with gross margin between 37 percent and 38 percent. Over the past year, Apple’s own guidance has been much more accurate, with the upper end of the forecast very close to what it actually reported.
In other words, analysts and Apple itself all anticipated a flat quarter — flat revenue, flat gross margin, flat net profit, flat everything. This was mostly due to a slight decline in iPad sales and a slight increase in iPhone sales.
But this quarter is an exception. Apple performed better than anticipated. In particular, the iPhone was a big seller this quarter. It could come from better international performance, and especially in China.
Apple sold 43.7 million iPhones, 16.4 million iPads and 4.1 million Macs in the quarter. Compared to Q2 2013, iPhone sales grew by 16.8 percent while iPad sales declined by 15.9 percent. Read all the details about hardware sales in our separate post.
“We’re very proud of our quarterly results, especially our strong iPhone sales and record revenue from services,” Apple CEO Tim Cook wrote in the release. “We’re eagerly looking forward to introducing more new products and services that only Apple could bring to market.”
China is one of the main reasons behind today’s performance. Apple has a hard time selling more devices in countries where it is already well established — it has to look elsewhere. Moreover, China Mobile recently added support for the iPhone. While Q1 is usually a very strong quarter for Apple, the company actually performed better in Q2 2014 compared to Q1 in China. Read more about this in our separate post.
The company also made a few announcements regarding its financial strategy. First, it’s going to make a 7 for 1 stock split on June 1. It just added $30 billion to its share buyback program. And finally, the dividend was increased by 8 percent. It’s an impressive buyback program.
Apple has been pursuing an aggressive share buyback strategy. In February, the company repurchased $14 billion of Apple shares. Buying back your own shares is an alternative to issuing dividends and proves that you think that your stock is currently underpriced. So far, it doesn’t seem to have a significant impact on the stock price.
But today’s update just changed that. Shares jumped more than 7 percent following the announcement. Read about Apple’s financial strategy in our dedicated post.
Apple’s own guidance for Q3 2014 predicts between $36 billion and $38 billion in revenue with a flat gross margin between 37 and 38 percent. The company reported $35.3 billion in revenue last year, so Apple is still a growing company.

Later today, Apple will report its fiscal Q2 2014 earnings. Apple CFO Peter Oppenheimer said in the previous earnings call that the company expected more or less a flat quarter in Q2. And analysts agree. Apple should report flat revenue, flat gross margin, flat net profit — flat everything. But there are a couple of interesting numbers to look at.
The two main factors in today’s earnings should be iPad sales and iPhone 5c sales. iPad sales should be down year-over-year. Last year, Apple sold 18.1 million iPads. It’s a strong sales number — the iPad mini was still a relatively new product. This year, iPad sales should be down, but the question is by how much.
In the last earnings call, the company said that it was selling its tablets as quickly as it could produce them. It could have delayed some purchases, but it won’t be enough to offset the overall trend. As iPads are unsubsidized gadgets, many iPad customers probably don’t upgrade their iPads as often as their phones. It could explain why iPad sales are down.
iPhone sales should be up year-over-year, which should offset iPad sales. But the performance of the iPhone lineup largely depends on the iPhone 5c. While Apple doesn’t usually break down iPhone sales, it is clear now that the iPhone 5c is not doing as well as Apple anticipated. You can now see ads for the iPhone 5c everywhere, but you won’t see a lot of them in the wild.
It’s not necessarily a bad thing as the current model breakdown drives the gross margin up. But Apple thought the iPhone 5c was a true growth driver for the iPhone. Instead, iPhone sales should be slightly up.
In other news, iPod sales will shrink again, iTunes and software sales should grow a bit. While most of Apple’s apps are now free, App Store and iTunes Store purchases are still growing a lot.
When it comes to the stock market, Apple shares have been very stable for the last two months, oscillating between $520 and $540. The share buyback program didn’t have any apparent impact on the share price. Today is no exception, shares are down 0.53 percent so far.
In other words, the most interesting aspect of Apple’s earnings should be the subtext. Analysts are getting impatient and wonder whether iPhone sales won’t peak in the next couple of years. Tim Cook usually hints at upcoming products during the earnings call, but without sharing much detail. Maybe this time we will get better hints.

Earlier today Google released Docs and Sheets, two productivity applications for iOS. The unified apps work across iPhone and iPad devices.
The new apps are just picking up their first ratings and ranks. Docs has picked up 23 ratings thus far, securing a four-star rating. Sheets is also rated four stars, with a total of 11 ratings tallied. Docs is slightly more popular than Docs. Here is Docs’ performance so far today on iPhone:

 
And Sheets:

(All ranking data via App Annie.)
I think that Google’s productivity applications have had a decent, if not quite muscular, first day — considering that they are launching into markets in which both Apple and Microsoft vend products, and in which their parent doesn’t have a home-platform advantage. (TechCrunch did note this morning that for now, the new apps appear to be iOS only, but it’s probably reasonable to expect them to eventually make their way to Android, too.)
Microsoft has both an iPhone Office application, and recently released discrete Office apps for iPad, including Excel, Office and Word.
The Office for iPhone app (Microsoft Office Mobile) isn’t massively popular. Here’s today’s data:

On iPad, however, the new Office apps have had a big run, hitting the top slot on iPad (Word) in the United States, and also picking up several more of the top five ranks in their first day on the market. Four days after launch, Word for iPad was the top-ranked iPad app in 120 countries, after having launched in a total of 135.
At that moment, Excel was top 5 in 125 countries, and PowerPoint top 5 in 126. Word slipped in the following weeks, but is again the top iPad app in the U.S.
So, what’s going on here, and what does it mean? Frankly, I think that the release of Office for iPad undercut the release of Google’s productivity apps. Also, Microsoft released its products with far more pomp, dragging their new CEO back down to San Francisco for the launch. It also released three apps instead of two, making more noise inherently.
But even given Google’s more modest launch, and later-to-market timing, we can’t chalk up more than a fraction of the popularity differential — at least thus far — to those factors. It appears that far more people wanted Office for iPad than iPad versions of Google’s Drive suite.
Why, is a decent question, especially given the simple fact that Microsoft’s Office for iPad product is mostly knee-capped if you are not an Office 365 subscriber, and there are only a few million of those on the consumer side. You have to answer this question for yourself, but some reasonable guesses would be the remaining brand strength of Office, the fact that people are in some cases content to merely view documents, or that they simply don’t know that any other tool can do it.
Does it really matter which third-party company manages to win more productivity market share on Apple’s platform? Yes.
This is not only about market share on iOS or short-term revenues for either Google or Microsoft. Instead, it’s an important front of the larger platform wars. Let’s return to our earlier synthesis of Box’s S-1 document:
The [pressure Box is under] is amplified by a host of competition, and declining per-gigabyte fees. This cuts at what Box can charge for a key part of its value proposition, as larger, better monied players like Google and Microsoft beat each about the ears. The dance that Google and Microsoft are playing is different from what Box offers, but here’s the new reality: Cloud storage without editing and collaboration tools is moot, as are editing and collaboration tools without cloud storage.
Precisely. So, as each company both wants to ensure that it is the place where it stores your files, as then it can up-sell you editing tools, it also wants you to use its editing tools, so that you become more dependent on its cloud storage offerings. This symbiotic tautology creates a positive per-account revenue updraft for either Google or Microsoft, thus locking in long-term cash flows that have insane gross margins. The stuff that empires are built on or, in this case, sustained on.
And does iOS matter more broadly for Google and Microsoft? You bet it does. Not only has Microsoft built a host of apps for it, but remember that earlier note about what Google built today for iOS perhaps landing on Android — its own platform — in the future? Right.
While Office for iPad had a more explosive start than Google’s new offerings have posted, this is a very long game. How long? Answer the following questions: How old is Office, and how long will cloud storage live? That long.

Technology’s ability to harness the wisdom of crowds has created massive new businesses that support entrepreneurship around arts, craftsmanship, and technology while simultaneously re-shaping the market for personal lending.
With its new $14 million financing, CircleUp wants to change the development of consumer products with equity crowdfunding.
The Series B round was led by Canaan Partners, with commitments from previous investors Google Ventures, Union Square Ventures, Maveron and Rose Park Advisors.
Following the investment, Dan Ciporin a general partner at Canaan who sits on the board of Lending Club, will take a seat on the CircleUp board of directors.
“Crowdfunding, or peerfunding, represents a fundamental re-ordering of a customer, a user, and a product or a project,” said Andy Weissman, a partner at Union Square Ventures, which has backed Lending Club, CircleUp, Kickstarter, and Auxmoney. “We think it’s a fundamental re-ordering of the relationship and you can slice it in many different ways. CircleUp represented that fundamental reordering combined with the inefficiencies of entrepreneurs building consumer product companies.”
The CircleUp round closed in roughly one month, just days before the company’s two-year anniversary and the cash will be used to develop new data and analytics products for investors using the company’s equity investment platform, according to chief operating officer Rory Eakin.
Think of CircleUp as a kind of AngelList for consumer products companies. Rather than funding companies like Apptimize, CircleUp investors are looking for things like Portland’s Green Zebra Grocery, an organic grocery store; or the outdoor apparel and equipment maker Klymit; or even the latest socially conscious chocolatier to launch in Brooklyn (honestly though, fair trade plus chocolate seems like a great idea).
The problem that CircleUp addresses is one of scale, the companies selling consumer products are too small to raise the interest of investors like the private equity firms that first employed CircleUp’s chief executive Ryan Caldbeck. But the checks that these companies need are larger than a typical crowdfunding campaign.
“The companies that we work with have a different use case,” Caldbeck said. “The average raise on CircleUp is roughly $1 million. When you have a functioning business that has national distribution in every Whole Foods in the country or selling into every Nordstrom, raising $10,000 isn’t that helpful.”
CircleUp already has relationships with many of the major private equity players as well as consumer packaged goods companies like General Mills and Procter & Gamble.
And raising on the CircleUp platform seems to be paying off for the entrepreneurs that use the site. “The average company that has raised money on CircleUp has grown revenue 80% per year since their capital raise,” said Eakin.
Since the launch of its investment platform, CircleUp has helped over 30 companies raise more than $30 million. CircleUp’s featured companies in fourth quarter of 2013 averaged 185% growth rate with 37% gross margin and 2.9X sales multiple, the company said.
CircleUp makes money by charging a commission from the companies on its platform based on the capital they raise, as well as taking warrants in the companies that raise money on the platform. The company also gets money from partnership fees with large consumer products companies.
Venture investment in the crowdfunding space has grown over the past five years, and companies have gotten increasingly more expensive. In the past quarter alone five companies in the crowdfunding raised $75 million in new financing.

Editor’s Note: Semil Shah works on product for Swell, is a TechCrunch columnist, and an investor at Haystack. He blogs at Haywire, and you can follow him on Twitter at @semil.
Last week, my column discussed how on-demand mobile services — Tap Your Phone, Get Stuff — are ripe for venture capital investment. In the seven days that have passed, more startups in this category have been handsomely funded by some of the best investors in the world. And, to cap off the week, the leader in this category, Uber, announced UberRUSH, its local courier service. After years of savvy, brilliant PR campaigns to deliver ice cream via old-school ice cream trucks, Christmas trees, kittens and cupcakes, and most recently, the ability for Silicon Valley entrepreneurs to hail a black car and directly pitch some of the partners at Google Ventures for possible investment, Uber has finally signaled (publicly) that it’s a company that its ambitions are much broader than just transportation. For a mobile company on a roll like Uber, it is a captivating move, yet also raises critical questions related to other on-demand startups, their specific business and operational models, and ultimately, how consumers may behave in the future.
There is huge potential locked inside the “Uber” brand. Just like Google wants us to visit its home page, enter a term, and then leave, Uber wants people around the world to open its app, tap a few buttons, and then leave the app, get in a car, and go on with life. While the Bay Area, New York, and other select cities around the country host a slew of mobile on-demand service startups, Uber is the one mobile consumer brand which has painstakingly carved out great geographical penetration. On top of this, Uber’s daily active use case means people are using the times multiple times per week, if not per day, meaning they could leverage that consumer attention for other offerings. With RUSH, smartly, they elected for a more business-focused solution, extending their expertise into a naturally adjacent use case which occurs in every city worldwide and is often, like cabs, run by smaller companies with outdated networks.
Let us see how RUSH evolves. It will take time. And while I wouldn’t bet against Uber on anything, there may some underestimation of just how hard this kind of horizontal expansion can be. While we can certainly envision opening the Uber mobile app in five years and seeing a menu of choices beyond cars, making those additional services a reality is excruciating work and could take years to form. Lucky for Uber, it has time, money, and the brand to make it happen.
In the meantime, the introduction of RUSH raises large questions. It’s too early to what will happen and know what the answers will be, so in the meantime, we can debate what path other local service models powered by mobile may do to keep things competitive. Here are the three big questions triggered by Uber’s expansion into RUSH:
First, from the perspective of business and operations, should various mobile on-demand services remain verticalized and standalone, or does it make more sense to consolidate? It might be seductive to assume, in the name of efficiency, that it will make the most sense to consolidate these mobile on-demand services, but the reality is that each of the growing services — for grocery, for deliveries, and so forth — run on different business and operational models.
Second, are all mobile on-demand services created equally? After Uber, what do the gross margins of other mobile on-demand services look like, and given those other offerings, how does one think about ranking the opportunity ahead of each one? RUSH makes a great deal of sense to me because it already happens ad-hoc in every city and extends Uber’s offering to a clear business use case, but it’s unclear what they’d offer next.
And, third, perhaps the most critical question: Will the consumer masses prefer to have all of these types of services under one umbrella, or would consumers prefer more choice within verticals? All the strategy whiteboarding in the world won’t be able to predict the answer to this question, and that, combined with the ripe funding environment for such businesses, is a very good thing for consumers, for those looking for jobs, and the entrepreneurs who may just uncover the next great mobile on-demand service.

So you are a company. You’re about six years old. You’ve raised $181 million dollars to date, including a Box-esque $100 million Series D bloc. The tough bit is that your revenue in 2013 was a mere $13 million. Even more troubling, your losses are accelerating, increasing from  $19.9 million in 2011, to $35 million in 2012 to $62.2 million in 2013.
You lost $6.28 per share last year, so the obvious next move is to go public, yeah? Yeah.
So you do that, pricing your shares between $9 to $11. But demand is hot, so you move that up to $13 to $15 per share. In the end, you land on a price of $16 per share.
That per-share price puts your valuation at what? $1.39 billion? And you are going to snag $178 million presuming that you sell all 11.1 million shares on your IPO day.
Turns out you guessed too low. Investors, after watching you ratchet up your offer price from single digits, bounce your shares to $39.80 a share, spiking your valuation to, wait for it, more than $3 billion.
Naw, I’m not messing with you about some stupid story from 1999. That IPO happened today. The company is Castlight Health.
Surprised? The market appears to be betting that the company’s growing business backlog will rapidly expand its top line, and help the firm approach profitability. Here’s the company’s S-1 filing detailing its current aggregate-future-business scorecard:
[O]ur total backlog, which we define as including both cancellable and non-cancellable portions of our customer agreements that we have not yet billed, has increased from $44.0 million as of December 31, 2012 to $108.7 million as of December 31, 2013.
The company could have very strong gross margins: The cost of revenue for 13 million in 2013 top line was $125,000. So, you can see how the company reaches profitability provided that it can scale to service its full backlog in a timely manner.
For more on the firm, TechCrunch went in-depth on their products and future at the time of their last funding event.
Investors are betting big that Castlight is a rocket ship. We’ll see in its first quarterly report if that’s right.

One of the most important functions of any modern financial institution is conducting valuations. On Wall Street, this means developing financial models – projections of how a company will perform based on a set of assumptions. Get these models right, and suddenly you can make trades on public equities that bring in enormous profits. Blow it, and see billions of dollars evaporate.
Despite the importance of financial models, the process behind modeling remains as cumbersome as ever. Since today’s analysts develop models using Microsoft Excel and collaborate through email, it is difficult for multiple analysts to work on the same document at once. Even more worrisome, assumptions and models are rarely version-controlled, which means that mistakes have a tendency to amplify given the frenetic pace of a trading floor.
This is the world that Justin Zhen and Gregory Ugwi discovered when they graduated from Princeton together and joined Wall Street in the heyday years before 2008. Now, as founders of Thinknum, a platform for financial analysis currently in beta, they hope to dramatically improve this state of affairs by offering better access to key data and a significantly improved environment for sharing and collaborating on models.
The founders, though, are not limiting their vision to just a few analysts in Manhattan. Instead, they believe that better collaboration around models could do for finance what GitHub did for programmers – democratize finance by allowing anyone, anywhere to contribute to a better understanding of valuation and become recognized for their work.
Right now, Thinknum has two products: Cashflow Models and Plotter. With Cashflow Models, users can develop their own valuation models using an Excel-like product for the web. Similar to GitHub, once a model is built, analysts can openly share it for free, or securely save it for a price.
“Analysts often spend a lot of time rebuilding models again and again, but what happens if we could fork it?” Zhen asks. At any time, a user can take any model and edit its assumptions, parameters or formulas, allowing them to experiment with different approaches.

Data is fundamental to modeling, and traditionally, getting high-quality financial data has proven difficult for startups without the resources of Bloomberg or Thomson Reuters, the incumbent financial data providers. That changed recently, as the Securities and Exchange Commission has begun requiring financial disclosure forms to be submitted in XBRL format, the eXtensible Business Reporting Language.
Thinknum takes advantage of this new environment by allowing instant access to company financial data. Since the variables are standardized, this means that you can run the same financial model across an entire industry in a matter of moments. Or, using a tool called QuickBuilder, you can use sliders to adjust such variables as gross margins and revenue growth to evaluate the sensitivity of a company’s valuation.

One issue that modelers face is finding the right index data to compare a company to. For instance, modelers may want to compare a company to the rate of expansion of the manufacturing industry (using an index like a Purchasing Managers Index) or growth in the U.S. GDP. Through Plotter, analysts can evaluate correlations between data and use a visual tree to discover indices.
“In current tools that [analysts] use, they need to know exactly what they want, and they don’t see relevant data that they haven’t thought of,” Zhen says.

Most importantly, the entire product is designed to be used without a programming background, knowledge that is uncommon among traders and analysts. “If you are a quant, it isn’t as difficult to get data and clean it up. We are targeted toward non-programmers, who don’t have the same abilities. They may trade millions of dollars, but they don’t write code,” Zhen says. He hopes to maintain a focus on keeping the platform open to the widest number of people as possible.
Thinknum’s potential extends beyond getting a bunch of analysts on Wall Street to stop emailing spreadsheets back and forth. The founders hope to expand the company toward emerging markets where sophisticated financial tools are often lacking and analysts are disconnected from the global investment community.
While emerging markets have tanked in recent months due to uncertainty related to the fed’s bond buyback program and instability in Ukraine, Thailand, and Venezuela, there remains a deep market for better financial understanding of emerging market companies. Thinknum’s founders see better models as the first step to building a stronger investment climate.
“Creating communities of trust allows us to create insights into the market,”  Zhen says. “If you are able to create a large number of models, and get an average of all of those models, that number is really, really powerful.”
He hopes the impact of the product isn’t just helping investors make better financial decisions, but also helping groups like farmers better navigate a volatile global trading environment.
“Let’s say you are a tomato farmer in India. How would you price your tomatoes? How do you know what the trends are? With the explosion of Internet access, we believe we will provide a lot of value in connecting these people to global trends in prices. Right now, it may seem like a sophisticated tool for financial analysts, but our grand vision is to provide this information and insight to all kinds of different types of people.”
For a company only a couple of months into production, there is obviously much to do. The sharing mechanisms can be a bit clunky, and the user interface has definitely been bootstrapped by a pair of former investment professionals. But the company already has several paying customers, indicating at least some desire on the part of the industry to find a better toolset. The company hopes that allowing charts to be embeddable in websites will give it wider distribution, and further improvement to its user experience should broaden the site’s appeal.
As investment banking undergoes a number of changes (like requiring that entry-level analysts take Saturdays off!), it’s time to look into the technical infrastructure of financial analysis and improve upon tools first developed in the 1980s. Along the way, we have the opportunity to open up finance from a handful of major cities to anyone with an Internet connection.

Video ad platform TubeMogul has filed its S-1, declaring its plans to go public with an offering of up to $75 million. And it’s doing so with what appears to be pretty healthy gross margins, though with an overall net loss.
Once upon a time, TubeMogul was a video analytics company. But somewhere along the line, it morphed into an ad-buying platform that aggregates premium and transparent inventory sources.
In contrast to some of the other online ad companies out there, TubeMogul is more of a software-as-a-service play than it is a typical ad network, and its financials support that. Instead of just counting all the money that crosses its path on its top line, it breaks out the difference between “spend” and “revenue.”
Total spend on TubeMogul for 2013 was $111.9 million, which was up from $53.4 million the year before. And 2013 revenue was $57.2 million, up 67 percent from $34.2 million in the prior year.
TubeMogul also has SaaS-like gross margins, at 66 percent in 2013. Gross profit for the company was $37.5 million in 2013, compared to $17.8 million in 2012. However, the company’s net loss (which represents its gross margins minus the cost of sales) was $7.4 million, up from $3.6 million the year before.
(By comparison, when YuMe filed to go public last year, it had $116.7 million in revenue but net income of $6.3 million.)
TubeMogul’s IPO filing follows a number of recent exits in the video ad space. Tremor and YuMe both went public last year, while Adap.tv and FreeWheel were recently acquired by AOL and Comcast, respectively.
The company’s S-1 says that its plans for growth include global expansion, moving into TV advertising, and shifting customers to its Platform Direct (so away from its services business). As for risk factors, TubeMogul points to its past and current losses, as well as its dependence on ad agencies for business.
TubeMogul previously raised more than $50 million in funding. The biggest shareholders include Trinity Ventures (which owns 26.5 percent of the company prior to the IPO), Foundation Capital (22.7 percent), Northgate Capital (8 percent), co-founder and CEO Brett Wilson (8.8 percent), and co-founder and President of Products John E. Hughes (8.6 percent).

Editor’s note: Jonathan Sills is an executive in residence at Battery Ventures, where he helps advise portfolio companies on marketing strategy. Battery is an investor in Relay Foods and HotelTonight.
In Silicon Valley, it’s sometimes easy to focus solely on social and other types of cutting-edge, digital advertising when advising startups on their marketing strategies. But these businesses, particularly those serving specific geographic markets, can also amp up customer acquisition by combining their Facebook, Twitter and Pinterest strategies with old-school, traditional media marketing campaigns.
Radio spots. Local newspaper ads. Billboards. Cable airtime. These are all time-tested tactics for companies trying to acquire new customers, but they’re often looked down upon as liver-spotted has-beens in the thumping nightclub of today’s digital and data-driven marketing environment.
Detractors say these old-codger strategies lack the flexibility, adaptability and low-entry cost of a self-service cost-per-click (CPC) campaign. But it doesn’t have to be this way. Based on recent testing, I’m convinced that a certain kind of retro/digital mashup — a May/December marketing romance, if you will — can pay real dividends for startups willing to experiment and look past their first impression.
Consider Candy Crush Saga, King.com’s megahit game for mobile and tablet devices. Launched in November 2012, it quickly attracted a massive following fueled not only by organic and viral distribution online, but also relevant mobile advertising. Data collected by iSpot.tv and other third-party sources shows that Candy Crush then took its marketing retro: In March of last year, King began layering national cable advertising onto its marketing strategy, and significantly ramped up those TV buys in the subsequent quarter.

These commercials showed up on old-school networks like Game Show, TV Land, and the Hallmark Channel (Little House on the Prairie, anyone?). iSpot estimates Candy Crush aired 4,515 national cable spots in all (a lot!). The program that featured the most Candy Crush ads? Re-runs of the late ‘80s hit “The Golden Girls.”
Another innovative May/December strategy is the one recently pursued by Relay Foods, an online grocery retailer for natural and sustainable foods based in Charlottesville, Va. Right now, the company operates in only a handful of metro areas throughout the mid-Atlantic region. So it has to think locally when it comes to advertising to its target customers: educated, affluent women who love attending the farmers’ market but rarely have time.

Until recently, Relay acquired new customers mainly through branded delivery trucks that drove around its target markets, as well as word of mouth and targeted “street teams” that canvassed public spaces and offered Relay gift cards. But the company wanted to find new ways to amp up customer acquisition without breaking the bank.
The company tested almost a dozen different tactics, but finally hit upon an old-school/digital hybrid strategy that worked. On the digital side, the team ran CPC campaigns on Facebook with page-post ads that linked back to the Relay site. These spots targeted women 25 and older in the geographies Relay serviced and were purchased at around a one-dollar cost per click.
On the retro side, the team tested running “remnant” ads on local radio stations. These were inexpensive time slots that were discounted because they “remained” after other advertisers bought specific inventory but still hit the target audience. In Richmond, Relay paid about $25 on average for a traditional, 60-second radio ad, which meant the company could run 200 spots a week for $5,000. This gave Relay a pretty heavy mass-media presence in that market. It also cost far less on a CPM basis than what the company was quoted by digital-music service Pandora for ads targeting the same region.
Finally, Relay topped off the campaign with retargeting, working to re-engage and convert potential customers who didn’t sign up immediately, through both Facebook’s exchange and the broader web.
The results? The company started averaging about 1,000 new customer acquisitions a week, up from fewer than 100. Sales, gross margin and contribution margin shot up, and Relay was able to mine this radio audience for months before shifting back to a mostly digital strategy.
Similarly, VistaPrint, the e-commerce leader selling business cards, stationery and marketing collateral, among other items, has for many years maintained a dual presence on digital and traditional media. One of the company’s arguably octogenarian tactics that I’ve admired from afar is the use of package inserts, which are printed offers placed inside the shipping box of an online, catalog or TV order.
Carrying an implied endorsement, they cost much less to get into people’s homes than individually addressed direct mail and can scale significantly. It seems like a great fit for VistaPrint, and Relay Foods also has used remnant alternative print channels successfully (with a regional distribution focus of course).

I could also see companies combining content syndication campaigns on Outbrain or Taboola with remnant print-newspaper ads, or Twitter with local cable. These types of mash-ups may become more common as we see other online/mobile companies build businesses serving particular cities or geographic areas, at least early in their life cycles — provided those target customers reside in the same markets. So this strategy would work better for local-meal delivery, for instance, than it would for car rental.
Yet many companies don’t consider old-school, local marketing because 1) it seems too outdated, and 2) it can actually be more expensive compared to national advertising, at least in audience-adjusted terms. Car dealers, restaurants and furniture stores traditionally have inflated the costs of such advertising, since they’re essentially held hostage to local media and may not apply a strict ROI lens to their media buys as they try to achieve strong reach in certain metro areas.
But by strategically marrying inexpensive, remnant local advertising with a well-thought out digital campaign — then spreading retargeting on top, like the icing on a wedding cake — online businesses can dramatically boost customer acquisition. And that’s a love story both young and old marketing professionals can embrace.

Egnyte, a company that sells a hybrid file storage product that employs both cloud and local storage, raised $29.5 million last December. The enterprise cloud storage market is among the best funded niches in technology, and it is also one of the most competitive.
With the recent entrance of Microsoft into the stand-alone business-facing cloud storage market, and the recent news that Dropbox has picked up an entire VC fund in new capital, I decided to catch up again with Egnyte’s CEO Vineet Jain to see how his company is faring, and pick his brain on his industry.
The company previously told TechCrunch that it expected to be cash flow break even by the end of 2014. It now expects to be profitable by the end of the fourth quarter. Revenue growth is still on target for $100 million in 2015. In short, the financial guidance that Egnyte provided TechCrunch in the fourth quarter of 2013 is still correct this year as we look to begin the second quarter.
More interesting is Jain’s take on a slew of recent industry events, given that he was willing to answer a set of questions with candor. So, without further chatter, let’s go. (Interview questions and responses have been lightly edited for clarity and condensed when reasonable):
TechCrunch: Your competition has raised far, far more money than your firm. Does that put you at a disadvantage?
Vineet Jain: The competition has been forced to raise a huge amount of money since the freemium model places a huge financial burden. Even though accounting tricks can be used to show a good gross margin by moving this expense below the line under “marketing expenses”, it still dents the cash flow. Indeed, a large amount of funding enables a big marketing budget and our approach to counter that is not to play the game on the same playing field. Change the level playing field by increasingly focusing on mid-market and enterprise customers where the “cloud only” solutions get exposed. Egnyte’s support for cloud and on-premise storage becomes a huge competitive advantage.
TechCrunch: Is growth in the enterprise cloud storage market accelerating?
Vineet Jain: Indeed, growth in cloud storage/online file sharing is accelerating as evinced by deals getting bigger and a major inflection point: Enterprises getting past the early adopter stage and just becoming mainstream. Interestingly, even though the SMB segment is highly contested (with the likes of Dropbox, Box etc), we [at Egnyte] are not ready to cede it to anyone since the total market opportunity is getting bigger and it is still a growth opportunity for at least another year. I do see file sharing and sync (FSS) becoming a commodity play sooner than we can envision, with players like Google and Microsoft causing a huge pricing pressure.
TechCrunch: The marginal cost per month for a gigabyte of cloud storage is trending to zero. How can companies in your industry replace that revenue?
Vineet Jain: Indeed, if the pricing attribute was based on storage, it will be race to the bottom. A situation increasingly being faced by backup solution providers. Pricing, instead should be based on per seat, and be reflected in value added capability that the customer is willing to play for. Even here, a horizontal approach will increasingly come under pricing pressure and will require an inexorable push to keep adding more value on the stack to maintain the price per seat. Better success will come by integration [and] enmeshing with [line of business] apps and their respective workflows where the customer is willing to pay more.
TechCrunch: Microsoft is moving into the cloud storage space, and with its on-premises software could post a material threat to traditional cloud storage companies like Box, and hybrid providers like Egnyte.
Vineet Jain: No one should take Microsoft lightly. In fact, I deeply admire the company (perhaps I am an anomaly in the valley in that regard) However, their continued focus on protecting their cash cows and being encumbered with solutions that were never really architected for the cloud, is a serious inhibitor from really embracing a true hybrid approach. Office 365 is an effort to provide the office apps in a hybrid fashion. But the other properties they have – Sharepoint, One Drive for Business etc. are stand alone products not integrated well.
One Drive fundamentally is a consumer class solution and does not have the semantics of a corporate file server. It has the same challenges as Google Drive – certainly easy to use, but inherently not scalable for the enterprise. Also, a cloud only approach in its case will be a inhibitor to pervasive adoption in the enterprise.
TechCrunch: What’s your take on Box’s impending IPO?
Vineet Jain: I really wish them well and hope that they do a good IPO and not mess it up. This will be good for the industry in general.
TechCrunch: Is Egnyte growing faster than market analogs, or slower?
Vineet Jain: To the best of my knowledge, we are growing as fast if not faster than others in this space and equally importantly, with better capital efficiency.
—
I’ll be checking in with Egnyte towards the end of the year to see if it still on track to meet its stated financial objectives. Until then, on burn both the platform, and cloud storage wars.

Global printing heavyweight Vistaprint has acquired a $25 million minority stakeÂ in Brazilian web-printing startup Printi. The purchase marks Vistaprintâs entry intoÂ Latin America, after assuming market leadership in the U.S., Europe and Asia.
Vistaprint bought out all of PrintiâsÂ investorsâ stake and a portion of the foundersâ stake in the company, but the founders still maintain a majority stake of the company and control the board. âThey wanted to acquire us 100 percent but we wanted to make it closer to what a VC deal would look like,â said co-founder and co-CEO Mate PenczÂ tells me on a call from Recife. âWeâre staying on board and staying completely independent.â
Vistaprintâs CEO Robert Kearne and VP of Portfolio Management Jeremie Profeta will join Pencz and his co-founder and co-CEO Florian Hagenbuch on the board. âOur investment is an important strategic step and we look forward to growing aggressively in Brazil,â said Profeta.
The investment comes at precisely the time Printi is outgrowing its model of outsourcing fulfillment to large printing factories, and the founders decided to vertically integrate production and construct their own printing factory in SÃ£o Paulo.
âWe had VC term sheets, but it came down to the fact that our business is a little unusual as a tech company,â saysÂ Pencz. âWe have a large manufacturing component, and in a lot of the VC conversations we were having, they did not understand the factory component. We admire the manufacturing expertise Robert has developed at Vistaprint and thought this could be a valuable asset to us once Printi reaches a certain scale.â
Printi made $3 million in revenue for 2013, and is on track to exceed $10 million this year, fulfilling about 6,000 orders per month. A source close to the company estimates gross margins at 40 percent. Pencz says business has grown gradually, with the help of high repurchase rates from loyal customers, and has been operating at more or less break-even since last year.
Printiâs only prior outside investment (Pencz and Hagenbuch put in about $50,000 of their own money to build the first website) was a $1.2 million Series A round with participation from Greenoaks Capital, Palantir co-founder Joe Lonsdale, serial Brazilian entrepreneur Fabrice Grinda and Groupon Brazil co-founder Florian Otto.
Mate Penzc (l) and Florian Hagenbuch
The $25 million investment capital from Vistaprint will fund the construction of their primary fulfillment factory in SÃ£o Paulo and also go towards B2B marketing with a mix of digital advertising, direct mail, radio and sponsorships, as well asÂ to scale production. They are also beginning to experiment with individual packaging solutions, like batches of private-label, customized boxes. âOver the next couple of years we have plans to expand to the rest of Latin America,â Pencz says. âAnd now we are Vistaprintâs exclusive partner for the region.â
How did Pencz and co-founder Hagenbuch, London finance executives who met as summer interns at Goldman Sachs in 2008, decide to attack the B2B printing industry in Brazil?
âIt was opportunistic,â says Pencz. âFlorian grew up in Brazil, and his father worked in the printing industry on the manufacturing side for Heidelberg Druck in Europe. What I found appealing is that itâs a niche market [$15 billion by Penczâs estimate] but big enough to build a big business.â
At a time of otherwise accelerated foreign interest in flashy viral-growth startups like Peixe Urbano, Groupon and Vostu in Brazil, Pencz says he felt uncomfortable going into something that felt too hot. âWe just didnât see the fundamental demand for these models down here. So we said, whatâs the least sexy thing we can do in the least sexy, most backward-looking, anti-innovation market we can find?â
When Printi launched in 2012, Pencz called Brazilâs printing industry âextremely corrupt,â and claimed it was âstuck in the 1980âs.â He says it hasnât fundamentally changed in the two years since. âAll of the same descriptions still apply.â
Consumers with print needs are relegated to the neighborhood selection of mom-and-pop printers. Printing a single black-and-white page at one such store in Ipanema Beach will run you close to $0.50. âIn B2B you also have a pricing issue and a transparency issue,â explains Pencz. âYou canât really call up the big printing company if youâre a small or medium-size business and get price quotes directly. If youâre Coca-Cola, then you can have a direct relationship to the printing company and decent pricing transparency, but not small/medium-size businesses. You have to go through a print broker. So you have middle-men managing client relationships and intermediating transactions and turning the process extremely manual.â
Pencz saysÂ that the throwback status of Brazilâs printing industry is reinforced by the fact that âprinting in general in Brazil is still growing at decent rates, so some businesses are hurting, but not enough to try toÂ innovate.â Printi is the only player in Brazilâs web-printing space, although Pencz says a number of companies operating offline storefronts have launchedÂ websites.
âBut none of them have grown significantly because itâs an additional channel that competes with their main channel. So by definition, showing your prices online and being able to quote clashes with having hundreds of sales people running around and extracting highest price from your customers. Itâs a massive channel conflict, and nobody is willing to sacrifice main sales channel to do volume online.â
Printi takesÂ about 5-6 percent of its annual revenue from such offline companies like print franchises and coffee shops, says Pencz. A partnership in 2012 with offline print network AlphaGraphics was expected to bring in as much as $10 million in revenue per year, but Pencz says they encountered too many barriers to getting an offline partner to bring them orders at scale.
Printi currently services about 35,000 active customers in Brazil. While there are some big-name outliers like Santander, Netshoes, Baby.com.br and Intel, which send small or last-minute orders to Printi, Pencz says about 20,000-25,000 of their clients are small companies or independent professionals, and he doesnât expect that to change.
âItâs extremely difficult to change the purchasing behavior of the big guys. They want to pay later, or pay on different terms, and the bigger the company, the more bureaucratic it gets. Our path to least resistance is to find more small and medium-size clients.â
Printi also has no foreseeable plans to expand to the B2C market â for example, Kinkoâs services offline. âWhat matters to us is recurring volumes,â Pencz maintains. âYou have to buy at least 100 of anything you order. And good customer service, he insists, is what drives a lot of the repurchase rate. âA lot of people call before or after they make a purchase. Itâs a relatively complex product to sell online.â Of about 50 employees, six are dedicated to phone support.
âThe traditional market is fraught with bad service and a lot of resistance to attend to customer need, so we decided to offer exactly the opposite,â says Pencz. âEven if the problem occurred on the side of the customer, say they misspelled something on their business card, often weâll simply reprint it. Itâs part of our company ethos. Â We thought it would lead to a lot of customer complaints and fraud, but that has not been the case at all. We have a 2-3 percent complaint rate, and we take care of it. For us itâs a customer acquisition tool, and one of our cheapest acquisition channels.â
Printi spends about 10-15 percent of itsÂ monthly revenue on marketing, including search campaigns targeting customers dissatisfied with offline print services.
With the new investment round, Printi is the most heavily funded of a growing crop of startups making solid progress in unsexy, service-facing businesses in Brazil, including insurance comparison site ComparaOnline, which disintermediates insurance brokers, and travel meta-search engine Voopter, which disintermediates travel brokers. Now we can add print brokers to the list of disintermediated parties.
âWeâd be lying if we said we werenât doing it for the money,â says Pencz. âWe started Printi to make money, and did this round to make money, but the end goal is something bigger. We think the opportunity is very big, and weâd like to believe weâre helping transform an industry fraught with problems. On a day-to-day operational level, what drives me is seeing how small changes can lead to big improvements. How the flywheel starts spinning. Having tangible traction is super motivating.â

Following the bell, Intel reported its third quarter financial performance, including revenue of $14.55 billion and earnings per share of $0.66. Analysts and the street had expected that Intel would earn $0.65 per share on total top line of $14.45 billion.
In its sequentially preceding quarter, Intel earned $0.55 per share on revenue of $13.8 billion.
The company’s revenue rose $1.1 billion compared to its year-ago period, or 8 percent. More positively, its operating income rose 30 percent to $4.5 billion.
In after-hours trading, following its earnings beat, Intel is up several points. During regular trading, Intel rose around 2 percent. An inadvertent headline from a news organization sent a thrill through its shares earlier in the day.
Intel, a key player in the PC market, could be enjoying increasing stability in the sector. Recent IDC and Gartner numbers indicate that the PC market itself is now only barely contracting. According to IDC, PC shipments fell only 1.7 percent in the most recent quarter, compared to the year ago period, to 78.5 million units.
In the United States, again according to IDC, PC sales were up more than 4 percent from the year-prior.
Intel’s PC group had revenue of $9.2 billion, up 9 percent compared to the year-ago quarter. On the other extreme, its mobile group had revenue of $1 million in the period. Intel called that “consistent with expectations.”
Intel lost more than $1 billion on its mobile efforts in the quarter.
There is a certain historical irony that Intel is recovering, and even growing on the back of PCs, a market segment that many have tried to write off as irrelevant for some time. At the same time, its mobile business remains nascent. The company’s Internet of Things business managed a 14 percent year-over-year decline in the period, to revenue of $530 million
Next to PCs, only Intel’s Data Center Group managed to crack the billion dollar mark, reporting $3.9 billion in revenue in the third quarter, up 16 percent from the year-ago period.
For its fourth quarter, Intel expects revenue of $14.7 billion, with a $500 million margin of error, and a gross margin of around 64 percent. The revenue number feels conservative.
—
Microsoft reports its earnings next week. A strong quarter at Intel like this one could imply that other players in the PC space, of which Microsoft is a stalwart, might have positive results from the product category as well.

Still pushing hard on its strategy to be more than just a site for daily deals, e-commerce powerhouse Groupon reported its quarterly earnings today, reporting revenues of $757.1 million on non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.03, but a negative EPS of $0.03 on a GAAP basis.
Analysts were expecting a non-GAAP EPS of $0.01 on revenues of $748.76 million. Groupon managed to best expectations, but not by a margin that investors found too compelling.
The company is up a mere 1 percent in after-hours trading:

“We had another record quarter, with worldwide billings increasing 39 percent and reaching their highest level ever,” said Eric Lefkofsky, CEO of Groupon, in a statement. “We also made significant progress in our strategy to become the leading mobile commerce destination, with double-digit growth in our North American Local business, double-digit gross margins in North American Goods and positive Adjusted EBITDA in every segment for the first time in over a year.”
As a point of comparison, Groupon last quarter (Q2) disappointed Wall Street with sales of $751 million, missing their expectations by about $10 million while matching their EPS of $0.01. Its Q3 was up 27 percent on sales a year ago.
The company’s stock was up about 4 percent in trading to just over $6/share today before the results were announced.
Groupon, which has had a lot of ups and downs in its life as a public company. Most recently, its head of product, Parker Barrile, left the company citing personal reasons.
Despite this, Groupon in the last quarter has been continuing its efforts to build out its product portfolio and continue developing its services in a bid to boost its traffic and offset any declines that it may see in daily deals. That has included the launch of individual business pages to rival those of Yelp, a shopping loyalty and couponing app called Snap, and a more flexible model for how it lets businesses list deals based on specific times of day to improve footfall.
It’s slowly making some progress on these fronts. The company says that 100 million people have now downloaded its mobile apps globally.

Editor’s Note: Joe Floyd is a venture investor at Emergence Capital. Emergence focuses on enterprise cloud applications and has invested in market leaders including Yammer, Box, Veeva Systems and Salesforce. 
Questions about cash burn have blazed through Twitter like wildfire. Entrepreneurs are asking us: How do I know if I am burning money too fast? Unfortunately, there is no one-size-fits-all answer for an entrepreneur on what level of burn is appropriate for their startup. However, every entrepreneur should consistently assess their runway and revise spending against their strategic goals.
I have designed this short quiz to help enterprise cloud startups analyze their spending levels. It’s critical to monitor your company’s burn rate so you can make those quick adjustments to increase your chances of success.
Select the answers below that best describe your company.
1. Market Dynamics: Does your market have network effects?
a) Each sale is independent. If we sell to one customer it does not impact the likelihood of sale to another customer.
b) Economies of scale are important in our market and we believe that only three or four solutions will achieve scale. Early movers have a small advantage.
c) Every new customer increases the value of our product and becomes a source of new potential customers. Early movers have a major advantage.
2. Competitive Intensity: Who are your major competitors?
a) We are in a dogfight with a number of well-funded startups and large incumbents. Our sales team consistently sees competition for new customers, and we win as often as we lose.
b) We are competing with one or two large, entrenched companies. Our sales organization sees competition more often than not, but we win most of the time.
c) We are carving up a green-field opportunity. We sometimes face competition for new business but it is usually from consultants or internal teams building custom solutions.
3. Customer Retention: What is our churn?
a) We estimate that we turnover 1 out of every 4 customers each year. We haven’t really started tracking churn yet, but I would guess that our net annual MRR churn is ~20 percent.
b) We track churn and we know we retain 85-90 percent of our customers annually. We have increased our average sales price by 10 percent over last year. We also have a customer success team that upsells our most engaged customers, so our net annual MRR churn is only 10 percent.
c) We track each cohort of customers on a monthly basis and our customer success team excels at deploying new customers quickly and getting them engaged. We have negative MRR churn, and each monthly cohort continues to grow over time.
4. Sales and Marketing Efficiency: What is the return on every dollar of sales and marketing spend?
a) We spend $1 – $1.5 in sales and marketing for every dollar of total bookings (new and renewal). We do not worry about gross margins because we know they will increase with scale. We collect some contracts monthly, quarterly and annually.
b) We achieve a 1:1 ratio of sales and marketing spend to new annual contract value (ACV) bookings. We analyze customer acquisition costs (CAC) by channel, and we tend to payback CAC with gross profit in 9 – 12 months. We try to get cash payment up front for annual contracts.
c) We consistently receive $2+ dollars of new ACV bookings for every dollar of sales and marketing spend. We optimize CAC by allocating marginal spend to the highest performing channels. Gross profit pays back CAC in less than 6 months consistently. Our customer success team is deploying signed contracts quickly, and we always collect cash up front for our contracts.
5. Fundraising Capability: Who is in your investor syndicate and how easily can you add new sources of capital if you need to fundraise quickly?
a) We have a group of angel investors or constrained institutional investors. It feels too early to pursue debt. We are heads down focused on sales and product right now and we will think about the next fundraising when we need to raise more money.
b) We have one institutional lead investor with dry powder, and we think we can secure a small debt facility. Our investor can introduce us to venture firms so we can start a fundraising process pretty quickly if we need to do that.
c) We have two or more institutional venture investors and we have a small debt facility with our bank that we can draw down if we need it. We keep a steady dialog going with investors that we would like to involve in future financings so we could start a process tomorrow if desired.
What’s your score?
Give yourself one point for each “A” answer, three points for each “B” answer, and five points for each “C” answer.
0-10 points: Pull the ripcord. You need to evaluate your spending immediately and consider pulling back drastically. You may be too early in a nascent market, and it would be wise to conserve capital until the market develops. You may be facing too many competitors which is forcing everyone to spend inefficiently. You may want to scale back sales and marketing while you pivot your product to find a more attractive competitive position. Lastly, you may not be able to raise additional equity if the current venture environment sours. You should look to secure a debt facility and reduce burn to give your team the longest possible runway to succeed.
11-18 points: Pump the brakes. You are not in trouble yet, but you should quickly assess your situation. If you are targeting a large enough market, then you may be justified in continuing to spend on sales and marketing even if you are not that capital efficient. However, you should drill down and figure out why you are not efficient.
Do you have a churn problem? Do you face too much competition? Do you have too many sales reps? Not enough good sales reps? Are you marketing in the right channels? Is your pricing right? Is your product truly solving a customer pain point? Once you understand the drivers of your current business, you can reduce spend in the areas that are not efficient.
For example, if you do not quite have product-market fit, then you can reduce sales. If you do not have sales functioning perfectly, you can reduce marketing spend. Lastly, you should consider raising a top up round to give yourself 18 months of runway while the venture fundraising window is open or securing a debt facility to give yourself an extra 6-9 months of cushion.
19-25 points: Burn baby burn. Your sales and marketing engine is firing on all cylinders and you have proven you know how to engage customers and keep them renewing. Now is the time to pour fuel on the fire to attack your market while there is little competition. The viral effects are strong enough to justify the investment now, and investors will reward you for your efficient growth. Remember to keep monitoring your SaaS metrics so you can adjust your spend if your business slows down. Lastly, you should consider raising additional growth equity early while the venture window is wide open and valuations are aggressive.

Apple has just released its fiscal Q1 2014 earnings, reporting $57.6 billion in revenue, $13.1 billion in net profit representing $14.50 per share. Compared to the year-ago quarter, it corresponds to a growth of 5.7 percent in revenue, and 5 percent in EPS, with net profit flat year over year.
Apple sold 51 million iPhones, 26 million iPads and 4.8 million Macs in the quarter. As the iPhone remains the big money-making device for Apple, analysts had expected 55 million iPhones. Apple fell below those expectations. Compared to Q1 2013, iPhone sales grew 6.7 percent (more than Apple’s overall revenue) while iPad sales grew 13.5 percent. Read all the details about hardware sales in our separate post.
Apple CFO Peter Oppenheimer said in the earnings call that they sold 26 million iPads “despite supply constraints.” It means that it could have sold more iPads if it had more inventory. “We exited the December quarter near supply/demand balance,” Oppenheimer said regarding iPad production.
“We are really happy with our record iPhone and iPad sales, the strong performance of our Mac products and the continued growth of iTunes, Software and Services,” Apple CEO Tim Cook said in the release. “We love having the most satisfied, loyal and engaged customers, and are continuing to invest heavily in our future to make their experiences with our products and services even better.”
According to Fortune, the consensus among analysts was for Apple to report earnings of $14.36 per share on $58.1 billion in revenue, with both revenue and EPS growing. The WSJ expected $57.46 billion in revenue and $12.68 billion in profit, this time with profit down 3 percent year over year.
Despite an all-time high in sales with more than 50 million iPhones sold for the first time, revenue is below the street’s expectations. On the other hand, EPS is above expectations with flat profit. Gross margin was 37.9 percent compared to 38.6 percent in the year-ago quarter. That’s why net profit is flat.
As a reminder, Apple reported $37.5 billion in revenue, $7.5 billion in profit representing earnings of $8.26 per share.
Guidance from its last earnings release forecasted between $55 billion and $58 billion in revenue, with gross margin between 36.5 percent and 37.5 percent. Over the past three quarters, Apple’s own guidance has been much more accurate, with the upper end of the forecast very close to what it actually reported.
Software revenue is up 26 percent compared to Q1 2013. iOS 7 is installed on 80 percent of compatible devices. “It’s the most popular operating system in the world,” Oppenheimer said. iWork apps are now free on both OS X and iOS, but it didn’t affect growth for now.
Overall, iTunes, software and services represented $4.4 billion of this quarter’s revenue.
The company’s cash on hand greatly increased from $146.76 billion to $158.8 billion. It remains a great strategic asset for Apple. Yet, only $34.4 billion is kept in the U.S. 
Over the past couple of years, the company has become more generous when it comes to dividends and share buybacks, but it still managed to add $12 billion this quarter alone. Many tech companies would have loved to make $12 billion in revenue.
Apple expects to have a revenue between $42 billion and $44 billion for the next quarter, with a gross margin between 37 and 38 percent again. The company reported $43.6 billion in revenue for Q2 2013. In other words, Apple expects more or less a flat quarter when it comes to revenue next quarter.
Apple shares are currently down 5.7 percent in after-hours trading, mostly due to next quarter’s guidance and not today’s earnings.

Revenue in Greater China and Europe continue to grow year over year while it’s more or less flat in other regions. Read more about international outlook in our separate post.

Raising capital from investors is often a frustrating experience. While part of that frustration will always be present when working on high-risk projects, a lot of the aggravation comes from the lack of clear signposts that allow founders to judge their company’s performance. The reality is, most founders only ever hear a “yes” or a “no” from a venture capitalist, without a lucid understanding of the factors that influenced that decision.
There have been fantastic essays written about the fundraising process itself, such as Paul Graham’s guide posted last year. This post is not a guide to fundraising, but rather a look behind the curtain from my own experience as a venture investor at most of the quantitative metrics that are analyzed when judging an early-stage startup.
These metrics fall into five groups: financial, user, acquisition, sales, and marketing. While the statistics are important, the relevant weight any one metric will hold in a VC’s decision will depend on the type of startup, as well as the VC’s own opinion about which metrics matter and which do not.
When possible, I give guideposts on how to judge a particular value. These are from my own experience analyzing and engaging several hundred startups over the past two years, and all of my personal biases are certainly present. As with any guidelines in the venture business, companies break rules and expectations all the time.
Finances are crucial for any startup, and some companies are indeed funded by venture capitalists simply for having a great balance sheet and statement of cash flows. While this post could be a tutorial on the principles of accounting, I want to zoom in on a handful of key metrics.
Monthly Revenue Growth
Take the current month’s revenue, subtract last month’s revenue, and then divide by last month’s revenue.
One surprise for me is that this number is used more by founders than venture capitalists. The reason is that it shows proportion without magnitude, and magnitude matters a lot because a startup’s revenue is a major determinant on what the growth rate can be. If you made $20 last month, you need to increase that to $30 to get a 50 percent growth rate. That might be a single customer. But if you have a $10 million per month revenue business, reaching the same growth is significantly more challenging.
While VCs don’t use this metric as heavily as the next one we will discuss, some guideposts are still helpful. A growth rate of 40 percent per month is very good. A growth rate below 40 percent can be considered good if you can convince an investor that additional capital placed in sales and marketing will drive the growth rate higher.
Revenue Run Rate
Take the revenues recognized in the most recent month and multiply by 12.
VCs often talk about the current revenue run rate as well as the projected run rate in 12 months. So they will say something like “The company is currently at a $2 million run rate, but will be $10 million by the end of the year.” These numbers are often preferred, since they solve the magnitude problem.
Furthermore, almost all startups at the early stage are going to have to raise further capital. So when evaluating a startup, VCs are thinking about where the business has to be in 18–24 months when the next fundraise will happen. Getting a sense of the projected revenue run rate allows us to surmise whether series B or C growth investors are likely to be interested in a company. Thus, great performance is a revenue run rate that allows the next fundraise to happen. To get that number, reach out to investors and other founders until you have a good handle on the trajectory needed for your company.
Margins
Gross margin is calculated as total revenue minus the “cost of goods sold” divided by the revenue. Net margin is similar, except we also subtract the total expenses of the business as well (except for taxes and a handful of other accounting line items).
Margins are important because they show the ability of your startup to spend venture capital and get significant return. There are pretty bright guidelines on what your margins should be given an industry. For example, cloud storage and services companies can reach margins in the 90s, SAAS companies and other software businesses tend to be in the 70s, and hardware companies often struggle to get above 40 percent. Again, research your space until you know exactly what this metric should look like for your particular business.
One additional consideration is margin compression. Margins become tighter when competition is greater, so successful businesses must develop defenses against new entrants who might force a company’s margins lower. I personally have seen dozens of startups fail to receive funding because they could not articulate a strategy to avoid margin compression.
Burn Rate and Runway
This is the operating loss per month. To calculate runway, take the amount of available capital and divide by the monthly burn rate to get the number of months until your start-up runs out of cash.
These numbers show the efficiency of a business, the timeline for fundraising, and the need for capital. While startups are often run quite cheaply until their first fundraise, VCs will want to understand how you will increase your expenses to grow the business more quickly with any new infusion of capital. Lest anyone get the wrong impression, most investors expect their entire investment to be spent within 18–30 months. So if you’re asking for a fundraise of $10 million, but your monthly burn rate is $100,000, you must develop a very clear plan on how the burn rate is going to increase, and how that will propel the growth of the business.
Users are the lifeblood of any company, and therefore, VCs assiduously analyze everything about a startup’s users. Some user metrics are well-known, including daily active users (DAUs) and monthly active users (MAUs). I am actually going to skip those and instead will focus on a couple of other metrics that provide keen insight into a startup’s quality.
K-Value
Choose a time frame, such as one week. Take the number of users at the beginning of the week as a base. Now, track all invites that these users make to other people (for example, using an “Invite Your Friends” link). Aggregate the number of new users entering through this channel and then calculate the ratio of new users to old users and add 1. So, if you start with 1,000 users, and they bring on board 200 new users, we have a ratio of .2 + 1 (our base population) and that leads to a k-value of 1.2.
The k-value is a measure of virality, and is borrowed from epidemiological studies of disease progression. This number is exponential, and defines the magnitude of the user growth rate by word of mouth (as opposed to paid acquisition). For social media startups, this is often the only metric that matters (the other is retention).
Thankfully, there are some clear guidelines for performance. A value less than 1 means that the population is dying and will cease to exist. A value of 1 means that the population is stable. A value of 1.2 is strong, and a value of over 1.4 means incredible growth.
If you start with 1,000 users and have a k-value of 1.2 per week, after 30 weeks you will have about 200,000 users. But if you have a k-value of 1.4, you will have more than 17 million users within the same period. Growing at such a speed usually doesn’t last long, since old users are not as likely as new ones to bring additional users to the product (they already invited everyone!). However, some companies like Facebook and Snapchat have exhibited extremely high growth like this for an extended period of time, so it is certainly possible.
Proportion of Mobile Traffic
Take the number of visits from mobile and divide by the total number of visits to your product.
This is a simple ratio, but an important one in a world where more and more of our time is spent on mobile. Nearly every company that targets consumers and talks to an investor today will have to discuss their mobile strategy. Data today shows that people are potentially spending a majority of their computer usage on mobile devices. Engaging such users is crucial today.
Cohort Analysis and Churn
Take all of the users who joined a product in a given time frame (usually a week). Then calculate how many of these users engaged with the product over every successive week. Churn is slightly different and is calculated by taking the number of users who leave and dividing by the number of total users (regardless of start time).
Cohort analysis is a metric by which we see the decay in user engagement. Users leave even the most sticky products for any number of reasons. For instance, small and medium businesses may leave your product because they are shutting down operation. VCs really like to see cohort-analysis tables, because they give us a perspective on when users are leaving the platform.
First-week retention is probably the most immediately interesting number. For social media, 80 percent one-week churn is very high, 40 percent is good, and only 20 percent is phenomenal. For paid products like SaaS, churn and other conversion metrics tend to make more impact here rather than pure cohort analysis. SaaS churn in the low single digits (1–3 percent) is strong.
Seasonality can be an important component to elucidating cohort analysis. Education startups often see their users return at the beginning of the school year as people think through their software choices. Be sure your story includes all facets of your cohort analysis.

We know that users are important for a business, but they don’t often walk right through the door. Instead, companies have to exert significant resources to get users to sign up and potentially pay for the product they are selling. Thus, these metrics go to the core of a business model and its sustainability.
Cost of Acquiring a Customer and Payback
Take the amount spent on all forms of user acquisition (search engine marketing, content marketing, public relations, etc.) and divide by the number of new users within a given period. Thus, if we spent a total of $100,000 acquiring users, and we have 100 new users, we just paid $1000 per user (fully-blended).
This is the bread-and-butter of almost all subscription companies, but also applies to most other startups. While the fully blended number is interesting, it doesn’t give a venture capitalist a lot of information about the channels that users are joining from. Therefore, we often split this into paid and free channels.
Free acquisition is what it sounds like – someone started using a product without seeing an advertisement, perhaps through word of mouth, or maybe reading about it in the press. In contrast, paid acquisition is generally synonymous with advertising. If you spend $60 on Google AdWords and get one customer, you had a CAC of $60. We often express the number of free versus paid acquisitions as a ratio, since this can show if the growth of the user base is primarily organic.
There are a lot of signposts for CAC, almost all of them dependent on the type of business. In general, the higher the ARPU – average revenue per user – the higher the cost of acquiring a customer can be. In social media, this number needs to be as low as possible (and can be near zero if growth is purely viral). In e-commerce, great CAC prices are around $30–$60 per user. Acquisition prices above that are not uncommon, but they do require more diligence. Prices above $200 are pretty rare in successful online businesses. Then again, financial services often have CACs in the upper hundreds, so, as always, there are exceptions.
Another way to judge whether the CAC is reasonable is to calculate the payback time for a new user. In e-commerce, this is generally measured as the number of orders that need to be purchased to cover the cost of acquiring a customer. If the number of orders is one, that is fantastic – it means the customer is immediately profitable. For advertising-driven and freemium subscription startups, payback times of 3–6 months are good, and anything more than 18 months is likely going to be very hard to swallow.
Net Promoter Score
Run a survey among your customers asking how likely it is that they will recommend (i.e. promote) your product to other people on a 1 to 10 scale. Promoters are those who give an answer of 9 or 10, and detractors are those that respond with a 1 or 2. Calculate the proportion of both groups as a total of the survey population. The net promoter score is the proportion of promoters minus the proportion of detractors. Thus, if 50 percent of your customers are promoters and 10 percent are detractors, your net score is 40.
This is one of my favorite metrics. It shows how satisfied your customers are with your product and your overall experience. NPSs of 50 are considered excellent, and companies like Amazon and Google generally hover around such numbers. However, scores as high as 80 or even 90 are possible. Businesses that inculcate such fervency in its customers are highly valuable, and should raise capital easily.
So you want to have a company that has actual, flesh-and-blood customers? If so, then you are going to have to build sales channels to efficiently build revenue. These metrics are helpful ways to judge the success of those efforts.
Magic Number
Take the net growth of subscription revenue over two quarters, multiply by 4, and then divide by the total spend on sales and marketing. So if in Q1 we had $200,000 in subscription revenue, and in Q2 we have $400,000, and we spent $300,000 in sales and marketing in Q1, we would have $400,000-$200,000, which is $200,000 net growth, multiplying by 4, we have $800,000, and dividing by our expenses, we have a ratio of 2.66.
This is arguably the best-named metric here, and a favorite of Scale Venture Partners, which popularized it. Essentially what this metric calculates is our return on investment of spending a dollar on sales and marketing. For each dollar we spend, we get the magic number back in additional revenue. A magic number above 1 means that a company has found a way to scale sales and marketing to build sustainable profit growth. A number below 1 isn’t necessarily terrible, but it also means that the company is not scaling as efficiently as other companies.
Basket Size and Order Velocity
The average sales price (ASP) is the price of a typical order. Order velocity is the time it takes for a customer to make a repeat purchase.
For e-commerce businesses, these are among the most important metrics to calculate. ASP often drives the rest of a startup’s fundamentals, and so like run rate, acts as a clustering algorithm to quickly assess a startup’s business model for VCs. A high ASP generally means wealthier customers, fewer repeat purchases, more flexibility on the cost of acquiring a customer, etc. Order velocity also is influenced by ASP.
For instance, Uber is a low ASP, high-velocity e-commerce business, whereas One Kings Lane tends toward a high ASP but low-velocity business. There is no “best” answer regarding these metrics, but generally, the lower the ASP, the higher the velocity of sales needs to be to compensate.
Average Sales Cycle
Take the date that a customer is first contacted, and then the date that they make their first purchase. The difference is the sales cycle. Average across all customers.
Like ASP, the average sales cycle often determines a lot of the fundamentals of a startup’s business, and therefore tells us about how to think about a company rather than its performance. We tend to use average sales cycle for enterprise and subscription sales, whereas we use order velocity for e-commerce and other repeatable purchases. Sales to government and education institutions generally have the longest cycles, possibly two years or even longer. Sales to Fortune 500 businesses are shorter, generally 6–18 months depending on the product (for instance, software is easier to purchase than storage infrastructure). Converting a customer in a freemium model can take 18 months or more, but generally a cycle below one year is good.
Long Term Value
This is the total value of a customer over the life of that customer’s relationship with the company.
This metric is really well-known, so I won’t cover it in-depth. It works hand-in-hand with churn, since the length of the relationship is inversely proportional to the churn. Calculating this value tends to be really hard, and getting to a number that is actually comparable across companies is challenging. VCs often have to substitute more objective metrics like ASP to get to values that are more easily measurable. Nonetheless, this number is crucially important, particularly as a company scales for the long-term.

Startups are competing for the limited time and resources of customers. Understanding the size of a market and its composition is the final metric analysis, but also a key one, since it determines the potential ceiling in value for a company.
Total Addressable Market
This is the total amount of money spent in a startup’s defined space.
While incredibly important, there is a huge amount of fuzziness in any sort of market analysis. Startups may want to define themselves a certain way, and venture capitalists may have an entirely different market in mind when they analyze a startup.
Generally speaking, markets greater than $1 billion are good, and any market definition that uses the word “trillion” is likely to get a laugh from a venture capitalist. Often, describing the TAM is more an opportunity for a founder to demonstrate an understanding of their startup’s market than it is about actually getting a quantitative figure.
Average Wallet Size
This is a key metric for a lot of businesses, particularly enterprise companies. Average wallet size is the total amount that a single customer can spend in a given period of time for a category of services (i.e. its budget). This metric is important because it gives a sense of the financial capabilities of your customers, and it allows a VC to judge how expensive your product is relative to a customer’s appetite.
This number cuts both ways. Startups that charge a small amount compared to the average wallet size are just as risky as those that charge a very high proportion of the wallet size as their product’s price. You don’t generally want to be insignificant, nor do you want to be so large that you knock out an entire budget.
This essay is a crash course in the metrics used in the quantitative analysis of startups by early-stage investors. As I said before, every investor has their own approach, and every startup is unique. Guidelines here are general, and more specialized information from your specific space is always the most important benchmark by which to judge your startup’s performance.
I would like to leave with one important observation, and that is that one metric tends to drive the curiosity of a venture capitalist more than a complete set of decent ones. An incredible k-value by a social media company, an extremely short sales cycle in the Fortune 500, and an incredibly high net promoter score in e-commerce are just some examples of how a single metric can be the defining story of your company.
Finally, and perhaps most importantly, quantitative metrics are informative about various dimensions of a startup’s performance, but they are not conclusive proof of the worth of a startup. Dazzling products with superb design, strong teams, unique markets, and other areas are just as vital to the success of a business. Outstanding metrics are probably necessary to successfully fundraise (particularly today), but they are not usually sufficient to guarantee an outcome. Great companies are built from greatness, both quantitative and qualitative.

There’s been quite a bit of interesting financial commentary on Microsoft‘s Surface line of tablet-hybrids published recently. The Surface project loses money. Understanding the magnitude of those deficits is important.
The analysis led to the Verge’s Tom Warren asking the somewhat provocative question of whether Surface is the new Zune, a product line that improved throughout its life, but never achieved escape velocity.
Let’s take a look at the history of Surface, Microsoft’s comments on its vision for the product line, stack those next to its current losses, and then compare the product line to another Microsoft hardware project and see where we end up.
When I first encountered Surface in Redmond back in 2012, I was told along with the rest of the assembled press that the hardware line was ‘a real business.’ That’s to say that it wasn’t a hobby, and that Microsoft expected it to perform financially.
Microsoft reiterated the business line to me in an interview, conducted before the release of the Surface 2 and Surface Pro 2, immediately after I had first held the devices, again in Redmond.
This quote, from Brian Hall of the Surface team is worth meditating on:
Hall: We are running this as a business. But we also are running it as a long-term business. Which means that there are different priorities at different times.
Take dropping the price of [the first-generation Surface RT] to $349. That was to primarily get it into more people’s hands. That’s because we knew that the most strategic thing is more Surface users. People that used it loved it and became good advocates. And we had to get that seed planted, watered, and fertilized.
We want to have a great portfolio. We recognize that people start from price points in their head. And I think that they will see that each of these at its price point is an amazing value. If there is someone who wants a tablet that can really be productive.
That was the company’s vision when the Surface Pro 3 was presumably under development, along with whatever the Surface Mini was going to be. The latter, of course, has been shelved.
ComputerWorld did solid work digging into Microsoft’s earnings reports to suss out how much money the company has lost on Surface by comparing revenue statements with cost of revenue numbers when possible, and estimates of cost of revenue when not.
The gist is not pretty: “Microsoft has lost $1.73 billion ($676 million plus $1.049 billion) on the new hardware.” It’s actually worse than that, in my estimation, as ‘cost of revenue’ calculations don’t include certain expenses like advertising, something that Microsoft has spent heavily on for the Surface line.
ComputerWorld’s chart, even if it only takes into account cost of revenue, is worth ruminating on:

What’s visible is an improving gross margin using cost of revenue as the measuring stick, and a growing influx of revenue.
So, are the losses too staggering for Microsoft? There is a small tension here between Ballmer’s Microsoft, and Satya’s1 Microsoft: Ballmer was willing to plow billions into hardware, as evinced by the Nokia deal and his support of Surface’s early days — Satya just inherited the stuff. I’ve heard some rumbling that Microsoft’s new CEO wasn’t as big a fan of the Nokia acquisition, but I haven’t heard that he was at all inclined to jump off the Surface bandwagon.
I think it’s fair to say that Microsoft’s hardware efforts are not islands, and that the company’s work producing Windows Phone handsets isn’t utterly distinct from its Surface investments. As such, we can view them from something approaching the same perspective.
In both cases, Microsoft is working to build what it considers to be the best hardware for its platform. A platform it’s no longer exclusively tied to anymore, certainly, but still a platform into which it’s willing to pour money to help make it succeed.
I don’t think that the Surface line is in much short-term danger of being terminated. A few things are worth considering:
Stepping back the above only gets us to the point of saying that Surface isn’t likely to be cancelled in the short-term. If the product fails to grow its revenue, and shrink its losses, Microsoft could well push it over a cliff in the future. But that’s true for all products.
Therefore if the Surface Pro 3 can move units, Surface should be on decent medium-term footing. Past that everyone is just guessing.
“We are running this as a business. But we also are running it as a long-term business. Which means that there are different priorities at different times.” Returning to that quote after digging through the financial pit of Surface’s first few years of life implies a Microsoft that has a multi-year plan for Surface mapped out. I think it executes that plan, provided that losses don’t again materially diverge from expectations.
That $900 million writedown, in formal financial terminology, was a fucking shitshow. However, it hasn’t happened again, regardless of what impact the death of the Surface Mini had on last quarter’s costs.
We’ll have a new Surface revenue figure in just over two months. It, and the following holiday quarter should give the market, and company a pretty good barometer as to whether Surface Pro 3 was an incremental, or decisive improvement to its predecessors.
1 I am not sure why calling Steve Ballmer ‘Ballmer’ feels correct any more than I am sure why calling Satya Nadella ‘Nadella’ does not. So, Satya it is, but the change in name-location choice is really not my fault. I swear.

It’s a Friday night, and I am on the prowl. I’m with my friend Edgar, and we are looking for evidence of the increasing S&M problem among the denizens of America’s startup capital. We all know the story the past few months: it’s really bad right now, but don’t worry, everything will get better in time. But it is not getting better, and it’s time to call out our collective dirty little secret.
Our Sales and Marketing costs are killing us.
For years, subscription-based pricing popularized by Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) startups has been pitched to us as a way of reducing S&M costs. Traditionally, software was sold as a license along with a maintenance contract that ensured deep upfront revenues and a continuous stream of income.
Unlike the complexity of that on-premise implemented and managed software, SaaS was supposed to be simpler for customers to use and pay for. That simplicity not only saves on maintenance costs for overburdened IT departments, but also theoretically lowers the sales touch required for a sale, generating revenue efficiency for the provider. By pricing software as a subscription, startups forego upfront revenue from a license fee in exchange for higher and more reliable renewable revenue.
It hasn’t worked out that well.
The evidence is strikingly poor for the subscription model when it comes to actual dollars and cents. My friend and wingman Edgar, the SEC filings database, has all the proof. Just take a look at some of the recent technology IPO filings from the past few months to get a hint of the problem. Hortonworks, the Hadoop provider, filed its S–1 with the SEC last week, and the losses are mounting. The company made $33.4 million in total revenue in the first three quarters of 2014, but its S&M costs were $44.6 million in the same period.
New Relic, the SaaS application monitoring startup, announced its IPO earlier this month as well, and its earnings record is similar. The company had revenues of $63 million in the year before March 31, with $58 million in sales and marketing costs.
These high ratios between revenues and sales and marketing expenses are certainly not new for companies heading to the public markets. When I criticized Box and Square back in May, one component of that analysis was the companies’ high costs to sell a product to their customers. Box in particular had $124 million in revenue in the year ending January 31, but $171 million in S&M costs.
Now, I know the standard excuse here is that these subscription companies are “growing rapidly” and this is all just “an investment in the future.” With subscription pricing, the entire model follows from renewals, with the logic being that once you have acquired a customer, the profit margin will rapidly increase as active sales costs come down.
The challenge is that low-touch sales never seem to be low cost. If a customer is shelling out a serious amount of money from its IT budget to pay for a service, there is going to have to be constant attention paid to that customer to ensure that they are happy with the service while ensuring that they don’t defect to a competitor. This goes far beyond a support subscription, which handles the day-to-day maintenance of ensuring performance of the service for the customer. The CIO needs to know the provider is listening to their concerns, and that means a sales infrastructure.
Furthermore, gross margins for SaaS startups in particular are lower than for companies selling traditional software licenses, since these startups don’t just sell code, but also have to manage data centers and other infrastructure to maintain the software service. With less margin, startups should be more efficient with S&M spending.
But we don’t see companies lowering their S&M costs post-IPO. More than a year after its public debut, FireEye, a security platform for enterprises, had S&M costs that almost equaled revenue in its most recent quarter.
Even a company as massive as SalesForce has arguably not found its marketing scale yet. In its most recent quarter, SalesForce’s S&M costs represented more than 51% of total revenue, and more than 67% of gross profit. While the company is still expanding at a fast clip with year-over-year revenue growth of 28.5%, it seems hard to see the moment when its S&M costs will simply melt away with renewals continuing.
This is particularly noticeable when we move away from the SaaS IPOs to other technology startups. OnDeck, the small business lending startup, announced its IPO a few weeks ago, and its operations appear much more reasonable. The company had about $107 million in gross revenue and $48 million in net revenue in the first nine months of this year, with “just” $21.8 million in sales and marketing expenses.
Does SaaS still offer a compelling model for some startups? Sure, just take a look at Slack. Given its innate virality as a social tool in the workforce, it is entirely credible to believe that the company can have an off-the-shelf product with a subscription pricing model and avoid the S&M problems that plague others in the enterprise space. But it has an advantage with organic growth that few other B2B startups share.
Frankly, one of the reasons for the popularity of subscription is that founders believe they can simply avoid sales by putting a price matrix online and waiting for customers to come to them.
It might be time to admit that sales and marketing are crucial to startups from the day they are launched, and find better ways of building up efficient revenues earlier. That message needs to be heard particularly by technical founders, who should grapple and become comfortable hiring sales teams much earlier in their startup’s growth. SaaS is not an excuse to ignore higher-touch sales.
For in this competitive world, where startups targeting enterprise are competing not just with entrenched players but also other startups, sales matters more than it ever has. The winner of these markets is going to be the company that figures out how to get revenue growth without breaking the S&M budget. While we may have an addiction to S&M spending as an industry, we also have the tools and know-how to fix it, and it starts by placing product development and sales on an equal level.

Daily deals site Groupon says that travel is its fastest growing business category, and today it is launching a new mobile app that it hopes will help it capitalize on that more. Getaways by Groupon, a free app for iOS and Android, bypasses Groupon’s wider focus on local merchant deals to focus only on travel packages and hotels (25,000 offers listed right now), similar to the Groupon site of the same name. Getaways squarely puts Groupon up against the likes of Hotel Tonight, Kayak, TripIt and others that help smartphone users plan trips.
Much like Mark Zuckerberg’s argument for why Facebook built a standalone Messenger app, there are extra features built into the Getaways app over time that you can’t get elsewhere. But for those who can’t face the idea of downloading yet another app, Groupon’ says they’ll still be able to see travel offers in the main Groupon app, too.
“Travel will still remain an integral part of the main Groupon app,” says Simon Goodall, VP/GM, Groupon Getaways.
All the same, Groupon’s trying to push more people to its Getaways app. Those who download it and book a trip through it can get a 20% discount until November 14 if they use the APP20 promotion code.
And it will have some extra features, too, including the ability to Browse by theme, perform map-based searches, a set to flash travel sales with up-to-60-percent-off discounts; and editorially selected “market picks” based on “quality and value” that give people Groupon Bucks to use for other Groupon purchases.
The Getaways mobile app, like many of Groupon’s newest products, will be available initially in North America only. In this case, though, Europe was actually an early mover for Groupon’s travel strategy: Getaways will sit alongside Blink, a European app that Groupon acquired last year when it purchased the Madrid, Spain startup of the same name.
“Like most of our launches, we’re making this available first in the United States and Canada,” says Goodall. “The plan [is] to expand it internationally, over time.”
As Groupon continues to build out its portfolio of services taking people beyond its original premise of email-delivered daily deals, it’s not surprising to see that its latest product is a mobile app, and one focused on travel.
Simon Goodall, VP/GM, Groupon Getaways, says that in the year between Q3 2013 and Q3 2014, Groupon had over $908 million in gross travel billings, just under 13% of all of Groupon’s total gross billings in that period. That represented growth of 69% between Q3 2014 and Q3 2014. He also notes that “hotel” is also one of the most popular search terms on Groupon.com and the Groupon mobile app.
At the same time there is room to improve how well travel is performing.
In that same period, the gross margins on travel purchases were 16.2%, versus margins of 20.4% across the whole Groupon’s business. Given the lukewarm response from Wall Street to Groupon’s quarterly earnings last week (which beat expectations), there still seems to be a feeling inside and outside that company that it should be doing better.
To that end, Groupon has been pushing hard on mobile services and mobile apps.
The company noted in its Q3 earnings that it’s passed the 100 million download mark for mobile apps, and that half of its sales come from these apps. Like other platform companies like Facebook, LinkedIn and Amazon, Groupon has been trying to tap into this by launching more, and more vertically-focused mobile apps to sit alongside its main Groupon app. Recent efforts include its new Snap coupon app, Ideel for flash fashion sales, and Breadcrumb for eating establishments to offer mobile payments.
One thing that is not getting wrapped into Getaways will be Groupon’s assets from SideTour, an activity app that connects consumers with bespoke events and other things to do.
But users will be able to get discounts on events when they do book travel-related deals on the platform. “The app is focused on hotels and travel packages,” Goodall says. “By creating a dedicated and focused experience around travel, we can help people find exactly what they’re looking for or inspire them to go somewhere. While traveling customers our customers are encouraged to use the Groupon App to find great things to do, places to eat and more. If they buy one of our thousands of market picks hotels they’ll be able to use their 5% back in Groupon Bucks through that app while on their trip.”

In November, eight-year-old education company Chegg debuted on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol “CHGG.” In the days prior, Chegg had priced its initial public offering at $12.50/share, high above its expected range of $9.50 to $11.50, and raised about $187.5 million in total at a valuation of close to $1.1 billion.
One of the first to bring textbook rental online, over the years, Chegg found a wide audience as an online bookseller. However, more recently, with pressure from Amazon, Apple and others, Chegg has been undergoing a gradual expansion, and “re-positioning.” In spite of its survival and its high debut in its IPO, it seems that investors aren’t so confident — at least in its short-term prospects. 
Chegg debuted on the NYSE at $12.50, but quickly plummeted to $9.64 in its first day of trading. The following day, the slide kept pace, and Chegg was at $8.88 by market close. 
Three months later, the onslaught has continued. Yesterday, the company released its first earnings report since going public, and in spite of Q4 revenues of $77 million, which represented a 12 percent increase from the year prior, Chegg’s stock has continued to fall. By Friday’s close, the stock had fallen 22 percent to $6.17, where it has hovered since. 
Nonetheless, Chegg Chairman and CEO Dan Rosensweig called 2013 a “banner year” for Chegg, referring one would suspect to the fact that digital revenue grew 70 percent year-over-year to $16.7 million — 22 percent of total revenues compared to 14 percent in Q4 2012. Meanwhile, the company saw print revenue of $60.5 million, a 3 percent increase compared to Q4 2012, while its gross profit came in at $39.5 million, flat year-over-year on a GAAP basis. On a non-GAAP basis, gross profit was $40.3 million.
Its gross margins declined to 51.3 percent from 57.7 percent, while adjusted EBITDA (without textbook depreciation) was $18.6 million, relatively flat when compared to Q4 2012. This also included a $1.8 million loss on textbook liquidations during Q4 2013, and a $2.3 million loss on liquidations in Q4 2012. 
With a GAAP net loss of $5.4 million, investors don’t seem to be particularly confident. Chegg has only $76.9 million in cash on company balance sheets at the end of the year, and it’s still yet to prove that it can keep margins in check as it continues to attempt to increase revenue. 
The other issue is that Chegg’s forecast for the coming year expects lower gross margins and higher net losses — never a good combo — while print revenue increased only 3 percent over the same year. This is somewhat of a break from what it’s been able to do lately, as Chegg managed an about-face, growing revenue and keeping expenses flat. Part of the reason: The company now reaches 30 percent of college students in the U.S. and 40 percent of college-bound high school seniors. It’s a valuable demographic. 
Chegg was likely able to mask some of the holes in its playbook heading into IPO, but many are still worried about its long-term viability. And, while things weren’t too bad from an earnings report this quarter, it still has a long road ahead.

HTC has reported released its Q4 2013 results and the numbers do not look good. Furthermore, the Taiwanese smartphone maker expects revenue to decline even further in Q1 2014.
The Taipei-based smartphone maker posted quarterly revenue of NT$42.9 billion (about $1.4 billion USD). That’s a 28% decline year-over-year from Q4 2012, when HTC posted revenue of NT$60 million ($2 billion). Its net profit for the quarter was a slim NT$0.31 billion (about $10 million) and gross margin was 17.8%, but its operating margin was negative 3.7%.
HTC expects its revenue to drop even further in Q1 2014 to a figure between NT$34 billion ($1.12 billion) and NT$36 billion ($1.18 billion), representing its third consecutive quarter of losses.
Known for its premium Android smartphones, HTC recently added several devices to its mid-range Desire line and sold a champagne gold edition of the HTC One in certain markets.
There are signs, however, that the company is retooling its strategy as it struggles to recover from a year plagued with declining revenue, the departure of several key executives, and supply chain problems. CEO Cher Wang told Reuters that it will begin to sell more products priced between $150 to $300, including a new flagship phone, in order to compete with other device makers like Samsung and Xiaomi.

Swipely, a company that helps physical merchants collect credit card payments and market to their customers, now processes $2 billion in annual sales for its customers, it told TechCrunch.
The company released the figure in conjunction with new product features that will allow its product to be used by businesses that have multiple locations, harmonizing data, and allowing for partial access for leaders with single-location purview, for example.
Throughout its life, Swipely has reported its processing rate, allowing us to track its growth:
According to company CEO Angus Davis, Swipely has grown more than 50 percent for seven straight quarters. It most recently raised a $12 million Series B round early last summer. Swipely charges retailers a percentage of dollars processed, of course, and also fees for its other services. The company declined to comment on its potential to raise new capital.
The company also declined to comment on its financial metrics, but did indicate that it operates in a similar fashion to other SaaS companies, with high expected gross margins, and a “strong [Customer Acquisition Cost] ratio.” It was recently reported that Square, another payment-processing company, has gross margins of 34 percent. Square is processing payments at a rate of $30 billion per year, or around 15 times as much as Swipely.
The two companies have different customer bases, which Swipely has stated publicly a few times. TechCrunch reported when the company raised its last traunch of capital that its average customer processes around $1 million in payments annually.
Can Swipely keep growing at its past percentage rates? I asked the company specifically if the new product updates designed to better support companies with multiple locations will help it sustain its percentage growth rate. Davis estimated that the new capabilities could perhaps let them grow 20 percent more quickly than they otherwise might be able to, but also cautioned that since the technology is new, it’s too soon to be sure.
Also the law of large numbers comes into play at some point, at which Swipely will likely report the change in dollars processed in dollar, not percentage, terms.
Swipely has been growing quickly, and almost quietly. Let’s see how long it takes them to get to $3 billion.

Box, a cloud storage provider, today announced Box.org, an effort to offer free and discounted products to nonprofit and development organizations.
It’s a simple plan: 10 free licenses per group, and then 50 percent discounted service above that point. Box, which has gross margins of 79 percent as reported in its recent financial filings, can afford the discount. Also, presumably, as Box later expands its product mix, organizations that it brought on with the promise of cheap storage will be enticed to spend more.
Box offering a free tier and cheaper service to nonprofits is a nice thing to do. But there is an inherent profit motive behind the effort: Large aid organizations, for example, aren’t famous for their bureaucratic maneuverability. Thus, groups that Box gets onto its service will likely stay put.
As cloud storage itself commoditizes and the editing stack atop stored files becomes increasingly important, firms like Box want to lock in many-seat organizations that they can upsell into for years to come. So, Box.org is at once a neat act, and a decent strategic move.
It also absolves Box of some of its share of the lingering guilt ascribed to technology companies as agents of aggressive change to the Bay Area.
Box has filed to go public, looking to raise $250 million in its flotation. Market conditions have recently deteriorated, leaving its offering and others in a holding pattern of sorts. The company’s aggressive GAAP losses and presumed spiking ARR have put the company in an interesting spot: Do the accounting preferences of SaaS firms render GAAP losses in the short term irrelevant?
For now Box marches on with a new charitable offering.

Shares of Infoblox fell sharply today, to the tune of 36.84%. The networking company reported disappointing earnings after the bell yesterday, along with the coming departure of of its CEO.
How bad were the earnings? The company reported $61 million in revenue for its fiscal third quarter (2014), up a mere 5% on a year-over-year basis. The company lost $7.4 million the period on a GAAP basis, a larger deficit than the year-ago period. The company’s non-GAAP earnings also slipped, from $6.0 million to $3.8 million.
Nearly flat revenue, widening GAAP losses and falling adjusted profit isn’t great for a company valued on growth.
Shares in Infoblox closed today at $12.96. The company’s 52 week high is a stunningly different $48.97. That peak was reached in October of last year, a period in which a number of other technology firms saw their share prices skyrocket, only to come back to earth in the new year.
The company has seen massive losses in its value tied to its earnings in the preceding quarters as well. In short, for the past three consecutive calendar quarters, Infoblox hasn’t impressed the street.
The company released preliminary results for its second fiscal quarter on the 10th.
A third-party press release out yesterday indicates that an “investigation” into “possible violations of federal securities laws and focuses on the Company’s business and financial performance” is being undertaken by an external legal group.
The company’s guidance doesn’t inspire either, with expected fiscal fourth quarter revenue commensurate with the recently reported period.
The company gets what’s wrong: “Clearly, our top priority is to reaccelerate top-line growth and we are taking actions to improve sales execution.” Yes. The company’s GAAP gross margin of 77.4% is holding steady, implying that if the firm can get its growth engine back track, the company could be profitable in the future.
However, to get growing again, Infoblox may have to spend heavily, increasing short-run losses that could spook investors. The company’s roughly $260 million in cash and short term investments mean that it has plenty of cash-on-hand to pursue a variety of growth scenarios.
However, it will due so under new leadership. Instead of being forced out, CEO Robert Thomas is leaving of his — reportedly — own volition. The company’s Chairman of the Board stated in the company’s release that it “would be pleased if he would continue as CEO.” He’ll stick around until a new leader is found.
Hundreds of millions of dollars in market cap were lost today. Not the best day for Infoblox, or its formerly high-flying stock.
